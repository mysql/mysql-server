  "waiting threads" subsystem - a unified interface for threads to wait
  on each other, with built-in deadlock detection.

  Main concepts
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  a thread - is represented by a WT_THD structure. One physical thread
    can have only one WT_THD descriptor at any given moment.

  a resource - a thread does not wait for other threads directly,
    instead it waits for a "resource", which is "owned" by other threads.
    It waits, exactly, for all "owners" to "release" a resource.
    It does not have to correspond to a physical resource. For example, it
    may be convenient in certain cases to force resource == thread.
    A resource is represented by a WT_RESOURCE structure. 

  a resource identifier - a pair of {resource type, value}. A value is
    an ulonglong number. Represented by a WT_RESOURCE_ID structure.

  a resource type - a pointer to a statically defined instance of
    WT_RESOURCE_TYPE structure. This structure contains a pointer to
    a function that knows how to compare values of this resource type.
    In the simple case it could be wt_resource_id_memcmp().

  a wait-for graph - a graph, that represenst "wait-for" relationships.
    It has two types of nodes - threads and resources. There are directed
    edges from a thread to a resource it is waiting for (WT_THD::waiting_for),
    from a thread to resources that it "owns" (WT_THD::my_resources),
    and from a resource to threads that "own" it (WT_RESOURCE::owners)

  Graph completeness
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  For flawless deadlock detection wait-for graph must be complete.
  It means that when a thread starts waiting it needs to know *all* its
  blockers, and call wt_thd_will_wait_for() for every one of them.
  Otherwise two phenomena should be expected:

  1. Fuzzy timeouts:

    thread A needs to get a lock, and is blocked by a thread B.
    it waits.
    Just before the timeout thread B releases the lock.
    thread A is ready to grab the lock but discovers that it is also
    blocked by a thread C.
    It waits and times out.

    As a result thread A has waited two timeout intervals, instead of one.

  2. Unreliable cycle detection:

     Thread A waits for threads B and C
     Thread C waits for D
     Thread D wants to start waiting for A

     one can see immediately that thread D creates a cycle, and thus
     a deadlock is detected.

     But if thread A would only wait for B, and start waiting for C
     when B would unlock, thread D would be allowed to wait, a deadlock
     would be only detected when B unlocks or somebody times out.

  These two phenomena don't affect a correctness, and strictly speaking,
  the caller is not required to call wt_thd_will_wait_for() for *all*
  blockers - it may optimize wt_thd_will_wait_for() calls. But they
  may be perceived as bugs by users, it must be understood that such
  an optimization comes with its price.

  Usage
  ^^^^^

  First, the wt* subsystem must be initialized by calling
  wt_init(). In the server you don't need to do it, it's done
  in mysqld.cc.

  Similarly, wt_end() frees wt* structures, should be called
  at the end, but in the server mysqld.cc takes care of that.

  Every WT_THD should be initialized with wt_thd_lazy_init().
  After that they can be used in other wt_thd_* calls.
  Before discarding, WT_THD should be free'd with
  wt_thd_destroy(). In the server both are handled in sql_class.cc,
  it's an error to try to do it manually.

  To use the deadlock detection one needs to use this thread's WT_THD,
  call wt_thd_will_wait_for() for every thread it needs to wait on,
  then call wt_thd_cond_timedwait(). When thread releases a resource
  it should call wt_thd_release() (or wt_thd_release_all()) - it will
  notify (send a signal) threads waiting in wt_thd_cond_timedwait(),
  if appropriate.

  Just like with pthread's cond_wait, there could be spurious
  wake-ups from wt_thd_cond_timedwait(). A caller is expected to
  handle that (that is, to re-check the blocking criteria).

  wt_thd_will_wait_for() and wt_thd_cond_timedwait() return either
  WT_OK or WT_DEADLOCK. Additionally wt_thd_cond_timedwait() can return
  WT_TIMEOUT. Out of memory and other fatal errors are reported as
  WT_DEADLOCK - and a transaction must be aborted just the same.

  Configuration
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  There are four config variables. Two deadlock search depths - short and
  long - and two timeouts. Deadlock search is performed with the short
  depth on every wt_thd_will_wait_for() call. wt_thd_cond_timedwait()
  waits with a short timeout, performs a deadlock search with the long
  depth, and waits with a long timeout. As most deadlock cycles are supposed
  to be short, most deadlocks will be detected at once, and waits will
  rarely be necessary.

  These config variables are thread-local. Different threads may have
  different search depth and timeout values.

  Also, deadlock detector supports different killing strategies, the victim
  in a deadlock cycle is selected based on the "weight". See "weight"
  description in waiting_threads.h for details. It's up to the caller to
  set weights accordingly.

  Status
  ^^^^^^
  We calculate the number of successfull waits (WT_OK returned from
  wt_thd_cond_timedwait()), a number of timeouts, a deadlock cycle
  length distribution - number of deadlocks with every length from
  1 to WT_CYCLE_STATS, and a wait time distribution - number
  of waits with a time from 1 us to 1 min in WT_WAIT_STATS
  intervals on a log e scale.

/*
  Note that if your lock system satisfy the following condition:

    there exist four lock levels A, B, C, D, such as
      A is compatible with B
      A is not compatible with C
      D is not compatible with B

      (example A=IX, B=IS, C=S, D=X)

   you need to include lock level in the resource identifier - a
   thread waiting for lock of the type A on resource R and another
   thread waiting for lock of the type B on resource R should wait on
   different WT_RESOURCE structures, on different {lock, resource}
   pairs.  Otherwise the following is possible:

      thread1> take S-lock on R
      thread2> take IS-lock on R
      thread3> wants X-lock on R, starts waiting for threads 1 and 2 on R.
      thread3 is killed (or timeout or whatever)
      WT_RESOURCE structure for R is still in the hash, as it has two owners
      thread4> wants an IX-lock on R
      WT_RESOURCE for R is found in the hash, thread4 starts waiting on it.
      !! now thread4 is waiting for both thread1 and thread2
      !! while, in fact, IX-lock and IS-lock are compatible and
      !! thread4 should not wait for thread2.

  'lock' protects 'owners', 'state', and 'waiter_count'
  'id' is read-only

  a resource is picked up from a hash in a lock-free manner
  it's returned pinned, so it cannot be freed at once
  but it may be freed right after the pin is removed
  to free a resource it should
    1. have no owners
    2. have no waiters

  two ways to access a resource:
    1. find it in a hash
       - it's returned pinned.
        a) take a lock in exclusive mode
        b) check the state, it should be ACTIVE to be usable
        c) unpin
    2. by a direct reference
       - could only used if a resource cannot be freed
       e.g. accessing a resource by thd->waiting_for is safe,
       a resource cannot be freed as there's a thread waiting for it

    we need a special rwlock-like 'lock' to allow readers bypass
    waiting writers, otherwise readers can deadlock. For example:

      A waits on resource x, owned by B, B waits on resource y, owned
      by A, we have a cycle (A->x->B->y->A)
      Both A and B start deadlock detection:

        A locks x                          B locks y
        A goes deeper                      B goes deeper
        A locks y                          B locks x

      with mutexes it would deadlock. With rwlocks it won't, as long
      as both A and B are taking read locks (and they do).
      But other threads may take write locks. Assume there's
      C who wants to start waiting on x, and D who wants to start
      waiting on y.

        A read-locks x                       B read-locks y
        A goes deeper                        B goes deeper
     => C write-locks x (to add a new edge)  D write-locks y
     .. C is blocked                         D is blocked
        A read-locks y                       B read-locks x

      Now, if a read lock can bypass a pending wrote lock request, we're fine.
      If it can not, we have a deadlock.

    writer starvation is technically possible, but unlikely, because
    the contention is expected to be low.

    strategies. This is how it works:
    Assuming a graph

      thd->A->B->C->thd

    deadlock_search() function starts from thd, locks it (in fact it locks not
    a thd, but a resource it is waiting on, but below, for simplicity, I'll
    talk about "locking a thd"). Then it goes down recursively, locks A, and so
    on. Goes down recursively, locks B. Goes down recursively, locks C.
    Notices that C is waiting on thd. Deadlock detected. Sets arg->victim=thd.
    Returns from the last deadlock_search() call. C stays locked!
    Now it checks whether C is a more appropriate victim than 'thd'.
    If yes - arg->victim=C, otherwise C is unlocked. Returns. B stays locked.
    Now it checks whether B is a more appropriate victim than arg->victim.
    If yes - old arg->victim is unlocked and arg->victim=B,
    otherwise B is unlocked. Return.
    And so on.

    In short, a resource is locked in a frame. But it's not unlocked in the
    same frame, it's unlocked by the caller, and only after the caller checks
    that it doesn't need to use current WT_THD as a victim. If it does - the
    lock is kept and the old victim's resource is unlocked. When the recursion
    is unrolled and we are back to deadlock() function, there are only two
    locks left - on thd and on the victim.
