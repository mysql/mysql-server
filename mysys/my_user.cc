  Parse user value to user name and host name parts.

  SYNOPSIS
    user_id_str     [IN]  User value string (the source).
    user_id_len     [IN]  Length of the user value.
    user_name_str   [OUT] Buffer to store user name part.
                          Must be not less than USERNAME_LENGTH + 1.
    user_name_len   [OUT] A place to store length of the user name part.
    host_name_str   [OUT] Buffer to store host name part.
                          Must be not less than HOSTNAME_LENGTH + 1.
    host_name_len   [OUT] A place to store length of the host name part.
