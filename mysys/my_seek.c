/* 
  Seek to a position in a file.

  ARGUMENTS
  File fd          The file descriptor
  my_off_t pos     The expected position (absolute or relative)
  int whence       A direction parameter and one of 
                   {SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END}
  myf MyFlags      MY_THREADSAFE must be set in case my_seek may be mixed
                   with my_pread/my_pwrite calls and fd is shared among
                   threads.

  DESCRIPTION
    The my_seek  function  is a wrapper around the system call lseek and
    repositions  the  offset of the file descriptor fd to the argument 
    offset according to the directive whence as follows:
      SEEK_SET    The offset is set to offset bytes.
      SEEK_CUR    The offset is set to its current location plus offset bytes
      SEEK_END    The offset is set to the size of the file plus offset bytes

  RETURN VALUE
    my_off_t newpos    The new position in the file.
    MY_FILEPOS_ERROR   An error was encountered while performing 
                       the seek. my_errno is set to indicate the
                       actual error.
