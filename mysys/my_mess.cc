/**
  Print an error message on stderr.
  Prefixed with the binary's name (sans .exe, where applicable,
  and without path, both to keep our test cases sane).
  The name is intended to aid debugging by clarifying which
  binary reported an error, especially in cases like mysql_upgrade
  which calls several other tools whose messages should be
  distinguishable from each other's, and from mysql_upgrade's.

  This is low-level, in most cases, you should use my_message_local()
  instead (which by default goes through my_message_local_stderr(),
  which is a wrapper around this function that adds a severity level).

  @param error    The error number. Currently unused.
  @param str      The message to print. Not trailing \n needed.
  @param MyFlags  ME_BELL to beep, or 0.
