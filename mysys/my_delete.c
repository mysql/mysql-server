  Delete file.

  The function also makes best effort to minimize number of errors, 
  where another program (or thread in the current program) has the the same file
  open.

  We're using 2 tricks to prevent the errors.

  1. A usual Win32's DeleteFile() can with ERROR_SHARED_VIOLATION,
  because the file is opened in another application (often, antivirus or backup)
  
  We avoid the error by using CreateFile() with FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE, instead
  of DeleteFile()

  2. If file which is deleted (delete on close) but has not entirely gone,
  because it is still opened by some app, an attempt to trcreate file with the 
  same name would  result in yet another error. The workaround here is renaming 
  a file to unique name.

  Symbolic link are deleted without renaming. Directories are not deleted.
