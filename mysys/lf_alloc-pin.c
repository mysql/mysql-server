/*
  wait-free concurrent allocator based on pinning addresses

  It works as follows: every thread (strictly speaking - every CPU, but
  it's too difficult to do) has a small array of pointers. They're called
  "pins".  Before using an object its address must be stored in this array
  (pinned).  When an object is no longer necessary its address must be
  removed from this array (unpinned). When a thread wants to free() an
  object it scans all pins of all threads to see if somebody has this
  object pinned.  If yes - the object is not freed (but stored in a
  "purgatory").  To reduce the cost of a single free() pins are not scanned
  on every free() but only added to (thread-local) purgatory. On every
  LF_PURGATORY_SIZE free() purgatory is scanned and all unpinned objects
  are freed.

  Pins are used to solve ABA problem. To use pins one must obey
  a pinning protocol:

   1. Let's assume that PTR is a shared pointer to an object. Shared means
      that any thread may modify it anytime to point to a different object
      and free the old object. Later the freed object may be potentially
      allocated by another thread. If we're unlucky that other thread may
      set PTR to point to this object again. This is ABA problem.
   2. Create a local pointer LOCAL_PTR.
   3. Pin the PTR in a loop:
      do
      {
        LOCAL_PTR= PTR;
        pin(PTR, PIN_NUMBER);
      } while (LOCAL_PTR != PTR)
   4. It is guaranteed that after the loop has ended, LOCAL_PTR
      points to an object (or NULL, if PTR may be NULL), that
      will never be freed. It is not guaranteed though
      that LOCAL_PTR == PTR (as PTR can change any time)
   5. When done working with the object, remove the pin:
      unpin(PIN_NUMBER)
   6. When copying pins (as in the list traversing loop:
        pin(CUR, 1);
        while ()
        {
          do                            // standard
          {                             //  pinning
            NEXT=CUR->next;             //   loop
            pin(NEXT, 0);               //    see #3
          } while (NEXT != CUR->next);  //     above
          ...
          ...
          CUR=NEXT;
          pin(CUR, 1);                  // copy pin[0] to pin[1]
        }
      which keeps CUR address constantly pinned), note than pins may be
      copied only upwards (!!!), that is pin[N] to pin[M], M > N.
   7. Don't keep the object pinned longer than necessary - the number of
      pins you have is limited (and small), keeping an object pinned
      prevents its reuse and cause unnecessary mallocs.

  Explanations:

   3. The loop is important. The following can occur:
        thread1> LOCAL_PTR= PTR
        thread2> free(PTR); PTR=0;
        thread1> pin(PTR, PIN_NUMBER);
      now thread1 cannot access LOCAL_PTR, even if it's pinned,
      because it points to a freed memory. That is, it *must*
      verify that it has indeed pinned PTR, the shared pointer.

   6. When a thread wants to free some LOCAL_PTR, and it scans
      all lists of pins to see whether it's pinned, it does it
      upwards, from low pin numbers to high. Thus another thread
      must copy an address from one pin to another in the same
      direction - upwards, otherwise the scanning thread may
      miss it.

  Implementation details:

  Pins are given away from a "pinbox". Pinbox is stack-based allocator.
  It used dynarray for storing pins, new elements are allocated by dynarray
  as necessary, old are pushed in the stack for reuse. ABA is solved by
  versioning a pointer - because we use an array, a pointer to pins is 16 bit,
  upper 16 bits are used for a version.

  It is assumed that pins belong to a THD and are not transferable
  between THD's (LF_PINS::stack_ends_here being a primary reason
  for this limitation).
