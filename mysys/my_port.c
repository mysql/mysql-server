  On AIX, at least with gcc 3.1, the expression
  '(double) (ulonglong) var' doesn't always work for big unsigned
  integers like '18446744073709551615'.  The end result is that the
  high bit is simply dropped. (probably bug in gcc optimizations)
  Handling the conversion in a sub function seems to work.

  It doesn't work to make this function inline.
