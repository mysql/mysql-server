/*
  Change size of file.

  SYNOPSIS
    my_chsize()
      fd		File descriptor
      new_length	New file size
      filler		If we don't have truncate, fill up all bytes after
			new_length with this character
      MyFlags		Flags

  DESCRIPTION
    my_chsize() truncates file if shorter else fill with the filler character.
    The function also changes the file pointer. Usually it points to the end
    of the file after execution.

  RETURN VALUE
    0	Ok
    1	Error
