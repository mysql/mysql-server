// string values, without having to set up the entire SQL machinery. It works
// just like any other iterator; you call Init() before doing any reads, and you
// call Read() until it returns -1 (no more data).

// The iterator is expected to only work on a single-column table, and the
// column must be given to the iterator constructor.
