  ==== Purpose ====

  Test if my_strtoll10 overflows values above unsigned long long
  limit correctly.

  BUG#16997513: MY_STRTOLL10 ACCEPTING OVERFLOWED UNSIGNED LONG LONG
                VALUES AS NORMAL ONES

  ==== Implementation ====

  Check if my_strtoll10 returns the larger unsigned long long and raise
  the overflow error when receiving a number like 18446744073709551915
