# NOTE: After exchanging open_ltable() by open_and_lock_tables() in
# handle_delayed_insert() to fix problems with MERGE tables (Bug#26379),
# problems with INSERT DELAYED and BLACKHOLE popped up. open_ltable()
# does not check if the binlogging capabilities of the statement and the
# table match. So the below used to succeed. But since INSERT DELAYED
# switches to row-based logging in mixed-mode and BLACKHOLE cannot do
# row-based logging, it could not really work. Until this problem is
# correctly fixed, we have that error here.
