# TODO: Note that this doesn't actually test the code which was added for
# bug#11338 because this syntax for prepared statements causes the PS to
# be replicated differently than if we executed the PS from C or Java.
# Using this syntax, variable names are inserted into the binlog instead
# of values. The real goal of this test is to check the code that was
# added to Item_param::query_val_str() in order to do hex encoding of
# PS parameters when the client character set is cp932;
# Bug#11338 has an example java program which can be used to verify this 
# code (and I have used it to test the fix) until there is some way to
# exercise this code from mysql-test-run.
