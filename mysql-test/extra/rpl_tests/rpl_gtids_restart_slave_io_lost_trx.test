#
# This test will verify if the slave SQL thread and the slave IO thread behave
# correctly when the IO thread is restarted in the middle of a transaction.
#
# It is expected that the IO thread will retrieve again the partial transaction
# from the beginning and that the SQL thread will rollback the partially
# retrieved transaction before applying the fully retrieved one.
#
# This test will insert some data in the master and then will stop the slave
# IO thread right after queuing an event of a given type, starting the IO
# thread again to fully retrieve the partially received transaction.

# Test will do the following five iterations
#     1.Stop I/O thread after reading GTID_LOG_EVENT
#     2.Stop I/O thread after reading QUERY_LOG_EVENT
#     3.Stop I/O thread after reading XID_LOG_EVENT
#        which is equal to I/O thread sync with master
#     4.Stop I/O thread after the gtid is in EXECUTED_GTID_SET
#       i.e., after sync slave sql thread with master.
#     5.Stop I/O thread after reading USER_VAR_LOG_EVENT
# and after that make sure there are no missing gtid events
# i.e., we will verify this by doing diff between master:t1,
# slave:t1.
