#
# This test will verify if the slave SQL thread and the slave IO thread behave
# correctly when the IO thread is restarted in the middle of a transaction.
#
# It is expected that the IO thread will retrieve again the partial transaction
# from the beginning and that the SQL thread will rollback the partially
# retrieved transaction before applying the fully retrieved one.
#
# This test will insert some data in the master and then will stop the slave
# IO thread right after queuing an event of a given type, starting the IO
# thread again to fully retrieve the partially received transaction.
#
# Additionally, this test also tests partial transactions with MASTER_DELAY
# configured and verifies that the applier thread doesn't wait for MASTER_DELAY
# when the receiver thread is restarted in the middle of a transaction, if MTS
# and GTID autoposition protocol. To test this, set $master_delay_test=1 and
# source this file.

#     5.Stop I/O thread after reading USER_VAR_LOG_EVENT
# and after that make sure there are no missing gtid events
# i.e., we will verify this by doing diff between master:t1,
