# Requires statement logging

# Clean up old slave's binlogs.
# The slave is started with --log-slave-updates
# and this test does SHOW BINLOG EVENTS on the slave's
# binlog. But previous tests can influence the current test's
# binlog (e.g. a temporary table in the previous test has not
# been explicitly deleted, and at the beginning of the current
# test the slave immediately writes DROP TEMPORARY TABLE this_old_table).
# We wait for the slave to have written all he wants to the binlog
# (otherwise RESET MASTER may come too early).

# We need an extra update before doing save_master_pos.
# Otherwise, an unlikely scenario may occur:
# * When the master's binlog_dump thread reads the end of master-bin.001,
# it send the rotate event which is at this end, plus a fake rotate event
# because it's starting to read a new binlog.
# save_master_pos will record the position of the first of the two rotate
# (because the fake one is not in the master's binlog anyway).
# * Later the slave waits for the position of the first rotate event,
# and it may quickly stop (in 'slave stop') without having received the fake
# one.
# So, depending on a few milliseconds, we end up with 2 rotate events in the
# relay log or one, which influences the output of SHOW SLAVE STATUS, making
# it not predictable and causing random test failures.
# To make it predictable, we do a useless update now, but which has the
# interest of making the slave catch both rotate events.
