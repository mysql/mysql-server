# Testcase for BUG#6287 "Slave skips auto_increment values in Replication with InnoDB"
# The bug was that if on master, INSERT IGNORE ignored some
# rows, and the table was InnoDB with auto_inc column, then on slave
# some rows received an auto_inc bigger than on master.
# Slave needs to be started with --innodb to store table in InnoDB.
# Same test for MyISAM (which had no bug).

eval CREATE TABLE t1 (
 a int unsigned not null auto_increment primary key,
 b int unsigned,
 unique (b)
) ENGINE=$engine_type;

eval CREATE TABLE t2 (
 a int unsigned, # to force INSERT SELECT to have a certain order
 b int unsigned
) ENGINE=$engine_type;


INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (NULL, 1);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (NULL, 2);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (NULL, 3);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (NULL, 4);

# An alternation of values which will conflict in t1 and will not.

INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (1, 1);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (2, 2);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (3, 5);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (4, 3);

INSERT IGNORE INTO t1 SELECT NULL, t2.b FROM t2 ORDER BY t2.a;

# Compare results

SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY a;

sync_slave_with_master;

# Now do the same for MyISAM
