# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that Seconds_Behind_Master is calculated correctly on a
# Multi-threaded Slave when replica_parallel_type = 'DATABASE'.
# The test covers these scenarios:
#
# 1) With two workers, check if Seconds_Behind_Master is calculated correctly
# when all the workers are waiting.
#
# 2) With two workers, check if Seconds_Behind_Master is calculated correctly
# when first worker compeletes first.
#
# 3) With three workers, check if Seconds_Behind_Master is calculated correctly
# when second worker completes first.

# Scenario 1: Slave executes insert to t1 and is blocked due to lock on t1,
# after 3s another worker on slave starts to execute insert to t2, this worker
# is also blocked due to lock on t2. After 2 more seconds we check
# Seconds_Behind_Master. Since 1st worker is still executing insert to t1,
# this means that slave is at least 5s behind master.
