# In this test case, we verify if some DDL statements implicitly commit a 
# transaction and are written directly to the binary log without going
# through either the Statement- or Transactional-Cache. 
#
# As any statement that goes through a cache is written to the binary log
# wrapped in a BEGIN...COMMIT, we proceed as follows:  
#
#  - create a transaction and insert some values into a transactional table.
#  - execute a DDL statement that is supposed to implicitly commit the previous
#  transaction. 
#  - Check in the binary log for a COMMIT mark which is supposed to be written
#  before the DDL statement.
#  - Check in the binary log if the DDL is not wrapped by a BEGIN..COMMIT. 
#
# For further details, please, read WL#2687 and WL#5072.
