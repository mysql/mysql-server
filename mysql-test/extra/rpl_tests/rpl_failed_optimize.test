# BUG#5551 "Failed OPTIMIZE TABLE is logged to binary log"
# Replication should work when when OPTIMIZE TABLE is 
# executed on a non-existing table.
#
# Due to patch for BUG#989, checking that an OPTIMIZE
# that fails due to a lock wait timeout on an InnoDB table
# is not valid anymore, as an mdl lock is hit before,
# thence no timeout occurs, but instead a deadlock.
