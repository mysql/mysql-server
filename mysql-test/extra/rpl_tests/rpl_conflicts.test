# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test that slave behaves well in some conflict situations.  The
# following are tested:
#
# - The slave SQL thread sees an 'INSERT' of a row with a key that
#   already exists in the table;
#
# - The slave SQL thread sees a 'DELETE' of a row that does not
#   exist in the table.
#
# In statement-logging mode, the first conflict type causes the slave
# to stop with an error and the second conflict is ignored.
#
# In row-logging mode, the slave behavior depends the value of
# @@replica_exec_mode on the slave: if @@replica_exec_mode is IDEMPOTENT,
# the slave should ignore the conflicting statement and continue
# normally.  If @@replica_exec_mode is STRICT, the slave should stop
# with an error.
#
# This test was previously named rpl_stm_mystery22/rpl_row_mystery22.
#
#
# ==== Method ====
#
# Create a table on master and slave, insert a row on slave, and
# insert the same row on master.
#
# Create a table on master and slave, insert a row on master with
# binlogging turned off, and remove the row on master with binlogging
# turned on.
#
#
# ==== Related bugs ====
#
# BUG#31552: Replication breaks when deleting rows from out-of-sync table without PK
# BUG#31609: Not all RBR slave errors reported as errors
#
# Bug in this test case:
# BUG#37718: rpl.rpl_stm_mystery22 fails sporadically on pushbuild
#
#
# ==== Usage ====
#
# This file assumes the following:
#
# - The test language variable $slave_is_idempotent is set to 1 if the
#   slave is expected to stop on duplicate key errors (i.e., if the
#   binlog is in statement mode or
#   @@global.replica_exec_mode=STRICT). It is set to 0 otherwise.
#
# - Replication has been initialized by include/master-slave.inc
#
# - The test adds a suppression for the following warning:
#    Slave: Can't find record in 't1' Error_code: 1032
