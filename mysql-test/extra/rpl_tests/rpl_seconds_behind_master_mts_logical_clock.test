# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that Seconds_Behind_Master is calculated correctly on a
# Multi-threaded Slave when replica_parallel_type = 'LOGICAL_CLOCK'.
# The test covers these scenarios:
#
# 1) With two workers, check if Seconds_Behind_Master is calculated
# correctly when two statements are applied in parallel on one database
# and both the workers are blocked to to lock.
#
# 2) With two workers, check if Seconds_Behind_Master is calculated
# correctly when the first worker is blocked.
#
# 3) With three workers, check if Seconds_Behind_Master is calculated
# correctly when two workers working on table from the same database and
# 3rd worker working on another database.
