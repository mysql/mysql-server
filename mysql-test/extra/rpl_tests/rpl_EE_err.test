# The test is not relevant when testing replication of error codes for
# statements that are not replicated.  The test below could be changed
# to rely on the replication of error codes for statements that are not
# replicated row-based.
#
# See if an EE_ error in one event of the master's binlog stops replication
# (it should not: in this configuration the EE_ error is probably not 
# critical). Example: you do a DROP TABLE on a table which has no MYI file
# check if START SLAVE, RESET SLAVE, CHANGE MASTER reset Last_slave_error and
# Last_slave_errno in SHOW SLAVE STATUS (1st and 3rd commands did not: bug 986).
