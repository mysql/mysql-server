# When the relay log gets rotated while the I/O thread
# is reading a transaction, the transaction spans on two or more
# relay logs. If STOP REPLICA occurs while the SQL thread is
# executing a part of the transaction in the non-first relay logs,
# we test if START REPLICA will resume in the beginning of the
# transaction (i.e., step back to the first relay log)
  
# The slave is started with max_binlog_size=16384 bytes,
# to force many rotations (approximately 30 rotations)

# We have to sync with master, to ensure slave had time to start properly
# before we stop it. If not, we get errors about UNIX_TIMESTAMP() in the log.
