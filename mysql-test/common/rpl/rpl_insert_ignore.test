# Testcase for BUG#6287 "Slave skips auto_increment values in Replication with InnoDB"
# The bug was that if on master, INSERT IGNORE ignored some
# rows, and the table was InnoDB with auto_inc column, then on slave
# some rows received an auto_inc bigger than on master.
# Slave needs to be started with --innodb to store table in InnoDB.
# Same test for MyISAM (which had no bug).
