# We need an extra update before doing save_master_pos.
# Otherwise, an unlikely scenario may occur:
# * When the master's binlog_dump thread reads the end of master-bin.001,
# it send the rotate event which is at this end, plus a fake rotate event
# because it's starting to read a new binlog.
# save_master_pos will record the position of the first of the two rotate
# (because the fake one is not in the master's binlog anyway).
# * Later the slave waits for the position of the first rotate event,
# and it may quickly stop (in 'slave stop') without having received the fake
# one.
# So, depending on a few milliseconds, we end up with 2 rotate events in the
# relay log or one, which influences the output of SHOW REPLICA STATUS, making
# it not predictable and causing random test failures.
# To make it predictable, we do a useless update now, but which has the
# interest of making the slave catch both rotate events.
