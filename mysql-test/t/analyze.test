# Bug #10901 Analyze Table on new table destroys table
# This is minimal test case to get error
# The problem was that analyze table wrote the shared state to the file and this
# didn't include the inserts while locked. A check was needed to ensure that
# state information was not updated when executing analyze table for a locked table.
# The analyze table had to be within locks and check table had to be after unlocking
# since then it brings the wrong state from disk rather than from the currently
# correct internal state. The insert is needed since it changes the file state,
# number of records.
# The fix is to synchronise the state of the shared state and the current state before
# calling mi_state_info_write
