# Bug #10901 Analyze Table on new table destroys table
# This is minimal test case to get error
# The problem was that analyze table wrote the shared state to the
# file and this didn't include the inserts while locked. A check was
# needed to ensure that state information was not updated when
# executing analyze table for a locked table.  The analyze table had
# to be within locks and check table had to be after unlocking since
# then it brings the wrong state from disk rather than from the
# currently correct internal state. The insert is needed since it
# changes the file state, number of records.  The fix is to
# synchronise the state of the shared state and the current state
# before calling mi_state_info_write

# Bug #14902 ANALYZE TABLE fails to recognize up-to-date tables
# minimal test case to get an error.
# The problem is happening when analysing table with FT index that
# contains stopwords only. The first execution of analyze table should
# mark index statistics as up to date so that next execution of this
# statement will end up with Table is up to date status.
