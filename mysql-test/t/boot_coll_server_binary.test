--echo # Bug#25054104 DATA DICTIONARY INITIALIZATION FAILS WHEN USING BINARY
--echo # CHARSETS
--echo #
--echo # Some collation names must be quoted. E.g. the follwing fails:
--error ER_PARSE_ERROR
CREATE SCHEMA s1 COLLATE binary;

--echo # While this is ok:
CREATE SCHEMA s2 COLLATE 'binary';

--echo # The collation used when creating the DD schema is taken from the
--echo # startup option --collation_server, but was not quoted, which caused the same
--echo # error as for s1 above. Fix is to add quotes (which is always safe).
--echo # This test runs with --collation_server=binary and getting here, shows that it
--echo # works.

DROP SCHEMA s2;
