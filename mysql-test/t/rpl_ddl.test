# NOTE, PLEASE BE CAREFUL, WHEN MODIFYING THE TESTS !!
#
#      1. !All! objects to be dropped, renamed, altered ... must be created
#         in AUTOCOMMIT= 1 mode before AUTOCOMMIT is set to 0 and the test
#         sequences start.
#
#      2. Never use a test object, which was direct or indirect affected by a
#         preceeding test sequence again.
#         Except table d1.t1 where ONLY DML is allowed.
#
#         If one preceeding test sequence hits a (sometimes not good visible,
#         because the sql error code of the statement might be 0) bug
#         and these rules are ignored, a following test sequence might earn ugly
#         effects like failing 'sync_slave_with_master', crashes of the slave or
#         abort of the test case etc..
