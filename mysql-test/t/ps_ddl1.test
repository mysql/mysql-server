# Testing the behavior of 'PREPARE', 'DDL', 'EXECUTE' scenarios
#
# There are several subtests which are probably "superfluous" because a DDL
# statement before the EXECUTE <prepared stmt handle> contained a keyword
# or action (Example: Alter) which causes that all prepared statements using
# the modified object are reprepared before execution.
# Please do not delete these subtests if they disturb. Just disable them by
# if (0)
# {
#    <tests to disable>
# }.
# There might be future optimisations of the server which decrease the amount
# of unneeded reprepares or skip unneeded prepare steps and than these subtests
# might become valuable.
#    Example:
#    Every preceding ALTER TABLE seems to cause a reprepare.
#    But if the ALTER only changed the table comment ...
