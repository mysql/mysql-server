# This test aims at using string/char literal in comparison operators  #
# without explicit type-cast. This is a bug test for Bug#11766521      #
# - Incorrect result is returned if string/char literal is used with   #
# comparision operator and bit data type column. Test is extended to   #
# include numeric data type comparison with string/char literal        #
#                                                                      #
