# ==== Purpose ====
#
# To a failed single statement transaction with a specified gtid on
# auto-commit mode, verify that we can roll back its owned gtid if
# does not modify non-transational table or commit its owned gtid
# if it has modified non-transactional table when rolling back it
# if binlog is disabled, as we did when binlog is enabled.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# See extra/binlog_tests/gtid_next_single_stmt_trx_rollback_with_non-trans_table.test
# and extra/binlog_tests/gtid_next_single_stmt_trx_rollback_with_trans_table.test
