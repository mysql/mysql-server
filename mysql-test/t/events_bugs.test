# Dear maintainer of this test. Please do NOT remove the next big comment.
# The tests for events were quite unstable over a significant time because the
# effects of events in general and their representation within the processlist
# were partially not known. Therefore I had to make excessive experiments.
# The comment with the outcome of these experiments will be moved into a README
# file as soon as the tests for events get their own testsuite.
#
# Outcome of some experiments (mleich, mysql-5.1 2008-12):
# --------------------------------------------------------
# 0. Most time used setup:
#    High parallel I/O load
#    set global event_scheduler= off;
#    sleep 3;
#    use events_test;
#    create event e_16407 on schedule every 2 second do
#    begin
#      select 'FIRST COMMAND', sleep(0.5);
#      select 'SECOND COMMAND';
#    end|
#    set global event_scheduler= on;
#    Start observation of the processlist
#  
#
# 1. SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = 'ON' and immediate observation of the processlist.
# 1.1 Effects around event scheduler:
# 1.1.1 First phase (very short)
#       No user 'event_scheduler' within information_schema.processlist.
# 1.1.2 Second phase observed (independend of probably existing events and very short) was
#       USER            HOST       DB   COMMAND TIME STATE        INFO
#       event_scheduler localhost  NULL Daemon     0 Initialized  NULL
# 1.1.3 Third phase observed:
# 1.1.3.1 Case we do not have existing events (rather long)
#         USER            HOST       DB   COMMAND TIME STATE                  INFO
#         event_scheduler localhost  NULL Daemon     0 Waiting on empty queue NULL
# 1.1.3.2 Case there exists already an event
# 1.1.3.2.1 Event executor is not visible in processlist but comes up soon
#           USER            HOST       DB    COMMAND TIME STATE  INFO
#           event_scheduler localhost  NULL  Daemon     0 NULL
#                   or
#           event_scheduler localhost  NULL  Daemon     0  NULL  NULL
# 1.1.3.2.2 A bit later, at least one event executor is or was visible in processlist
#           The states mentioned in 3.2.1 or a bit later
#           USER            HOST       DB    COMMAND TIME STATE                        INFO
#           event_scheduler localhost  NULL  Daemon     0 Waiting for next activation  NULL
# 1.2 Effects around event executor:
#     Typical processlist content:
#     USER    evtest1      -- Definer of event
#     DB      events_test  -- DB during time of event creation (use DB is not allowed in events)
#     COMMAND Connect
#     STATE   NULL
#     INFO    SET @evname = 'ev_sched_1823' -- Part of the event code
#
#     State before "User sleep select 'FIRST COMMAND', sleep(0.5);"
#     ID  USER            HOST       DB    COMMAND TIME  STATE  INFO
#     7   event_scheduler localhost  NULL  Connect    0  NULL   NULL
#     !! The user is not the event creator and the DB is different.  !!
#     !! This means that we must get later a change of the identity. !!
#     or
#     USER  HOST       DB           COMMAND  TIME  STATE                 INFO
#     root  localhost  events_test  Connect     0  checking permissions
#     or
#     USER  HOST       DB           COMMAND  TIME  STATE                 INFO
#     root  localhost  events_test  Connect     0  checking permissions  CREATE PROCEDURE ....
#     or
#     USER  HOST       DB           COMMAND  TIME  STATE  INFO
#     root  localhost  events_test  Connect     0  NULL   select 'FIRST COMMAND', sleep(0.5)
#     or
#     USER  HOST       DB           COMMAND  TIME  STATE                 INFO
#     root  localhost  events_test  Connect     0  checking permissions  select 'FIRST COMMAND'...
#     or
#     USER  HOST       DB           COMMAND  TIME  STATE          INFO
#     root  localhost  events_test  Connect     0  Opening table  select 'FIRST COMMAND', sleep(0.5)
#     or
#     USER  HOST       DB           COMMAND  TIME  STATE   INFO
#     root  localhost  events_test  Connect     0  Locked  select 'FIRST COMMAND', sleep(0.5)
#     or
#     USER  HOST       DB           COMMAND  TIME  STATE      INFO
#     root  localhost  events_test  Connect     0  executing  select 'FIRST COMMAND', sleep(0.5)
#
#     State "User sleep select 'FIRST COMMAND', sleep(0.5);" reached
#     USER  HOST       DB           COMMAND  TIME  STATE       INFO
#     root  localhost  events_test  Connect     0  User sleep  select 'FIRST COMMAND', sleep(0.5)
#
#     State at end (! It looks like a slow CREATE PROC !) of event code execution was sometimes
#     USER  HOST       DB           COMMAND  TIME  STATE               INFO
#     root  localhost  events_test  Connect     0  logging slow query  CREATE PROCEDURE `e_16407`...
#
#     State after running some event code was sometimes
#     USER  HOST       DB           COMMAND  TIME  STATE               INFO
#     root  localhost  events_test  Connect  0     logging slow query  select 'SECOND COMMAND'
#
#     State somewhere (I guess just before the event executor disappears)
#     USER              HOST     DB           COMMAND  TIME  STATE     INFO
#     Event thread fin  <empty>  events_test  Connect  0     Clearing  NULL
#
#
# 2. SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = 'OFF';
#    Immediate observation of the processlist.
#    Effects:
#    1. I never found the user 'event_scheduler' within the processlist.
#    2. Events just during execution could be found within the processlist
#       = It does not look like "SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = 'OFF'" stops them.
#         ==> Everything mentioned in 1.2 above could be observed.
#
# Several subtests were weak because they showed random result set differences after issuing
# "SET GLOBAL EVENT_SCHEDULER= off;".
#    1. Reason one: There were already event executors
#       Fix: Wait till there is no event executor active ==> no session WHERE
#            - command IN ('Connect')
#              There must be no parallel session being just in "Connect" phase!
#            or
#            - user = <who created the maybe current running events>
#                 There must be no parallel session of this person.
#              or user = 'event_scheduler' with command = 'Connect'
#                 The session which will soon change its identity to event creator.
#
#    2. Reason two: If an event modifies a MyISAM table than a delayed visibilty of changes
#                   might occur (concurrent_inserts=on).
