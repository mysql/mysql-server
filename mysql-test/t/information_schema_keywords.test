   FROM mysql.dd_properties) AS a`;

#
# 2. Convert the current server binary version into the 99999 format.
#
#
#

# IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT!
#
# If the test below fails with different result values, please
# check if two values are same: "$IS_version" and "$server_version".
#
# 1. The I_S version stored in the database is "$IS_version"..
# 2. The current I_S version in the server's binary is "$server_version".
#
# If #1 is equal to #2, then everything is fine and
# you are welcome to update the .result file with the new result.
#
# Otherwise, if #1 and #2 are different, it seems like
# this is a time to increment the IS_property in the DD mysql.properties
# table first!
# To force that update, please check the dd::info_schema::IS_DD_VERSION
# constant in the dd/info_schema/metadata.h file.
# The expected constant value is "$IS_version".
# If so, please update it with the "$server_version" value, and only then
# update the .result file.
# Otherwise, please investigate the divergence.
#
