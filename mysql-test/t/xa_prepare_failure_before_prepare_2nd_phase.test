# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This script tests server behavior when a crash occurs during the
# execution of `XA PREPARE`, after the transaction was prepared in the
# internal transaction coordinator and just before engines mark the
# transaction as prepared in the TC, when binary logging is disabled.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# Pre-conditions:
# PC1. Binary logging is disabled.
#
# After server restart:
# R1. There shouldn't be any changes to the data.
# R2. There shouldn't be any pending XA transactions visible with `XA
#     RECOVER`.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Setup scenario: create table and insert some records.
# 2. Start and execute an XA transaction containing an insert until before
#    `XA PREPARE`.
# 3. Crash the server during `XA PREPARE` execution, after preparing the
#    transction in the internal transaction coordinator and before marking
#    the transaction as prepared in TC.
# 4. Restart server and check:
#    a. Error log for messages stating that recovery process found one
#       transaction needing recovery.
#    b. There aren't any pending XA transaction listed in the output of `XA
#       RECOVER`.
#    c. There aren't changes to the table.
