#
# In SQL, conceptually GROUP BY (and thus also ROLLUP) happens before
# projection (the SELECT list), so GROUP BY on aliases is disallowed.
# However, MySQL extends the standard by allowing such aliases.
# This makes the following query ambiguous, and MySQL has gone back and forth
# a few times on what the implementation should be.
#
# After reading t1 and doing GROUP BY, the rows will look like this:
#
#   <group 1, a>  <group 2, b>  <group 3, a>  COUNT(*)
#   1             1             1             1
#   1             1             NULL          1
#   1             2             1             1
#   1             2             NULL          1
#   1             NULL          NULL          2
#   NULL          NULL          NULL          2
#
# Now, in the projection, what does the three parameters resolve to?
# It is obvious that b has to resolve to <group 2>, since that is the
# only candidate. The first a (the one without an alias) could resolve
# to either <group 1> or <group 3>, but we arbitrarily (and not unreasonably)
# resolve it to the one that is specified the first, ie., <group 1>.
#
# Now, what should “a AS c” resolve to? It would not be unreasonable to
# resolve it consistently with the first a, ie., to <group 1>. The alternative,
# which is what Postgres chooses, is to say that “a AS c” fits better with
# <group 3> due to the alias. Both are possible, and we make no guarantee
# that it will not change in the future, but for now, we've chosen to do the
# same.
