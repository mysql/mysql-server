# We force the slave to open t3 (because we want to try confusing him) with this :
insert into t4 select * from t3;
rename table t1 to t5, t2 to t1;
# RENAME may have confused the master (this is a known bug): so FLUSH tables,
# first don't write it to the binlog, to test the NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG keyword.
