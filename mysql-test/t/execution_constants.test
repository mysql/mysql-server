# Bug#21476: Lost Database Connection During Query
#
# When the amount of stack space we think we need to report an error is
# actually too small, then we can get SEGVs.  But, we don't want to reserve
# space that we could use to get real work done.  So, we want the reserved
# space small, and this test verifies that the reservation is not too small.
