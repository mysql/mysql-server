# There are various conditions when a server would regard mysql.event
# table as damaged:
# - the table has more column than specified in the compiled in value, but

# - the column count in the table is less than the compiled in value
# - some column has an incompatible type specification (for what is an
# incompatible type specification please refer to the comments in the source
#
# Unfortunately, in order to test a condition, we need to restart the
# server. Therefore, here we test only one simple case: changing the data
# type of the 'body' field to blob.
