# Clean up old slave's binlogs.
# The slave is started with --log-slave-updates
# and this test does SHOW BINLOG EVENTS on the slave's
# binlog. But previous tests can influence the current test's
# binlog (e.g. a temporary table in the previous test has not
# been explicitly deleted, or it has but the slave hasn't had
# enough time to catch it before STOP SLAVE, 
# and at the beginning of the current
# test the slave immediately writes DROP TEMPORARY TABLE this_old_table).
# We wait for the slave to have written all he wants to the binlog
# (otherwise RESET MASTER may come too early).
