# WL#6301: Change default value for the 'bind-address' option
#
# 3. Check that if the server is bound to the IPv4-mapped IPv6-address,
# the server accepts client connections from both IPv4 and IPv6 worlds.
#
# Options: --skip-name-resolve, --bind-address=::ffff:127.0.0.1
# (see corresponding opt file).
#

# Can't be tested with embedded server
--source include/not_embedded.inc

# The box should support IPv4-mapped addresses
--source include/have_ipv4_mapped.inc

--echo # Checking ::ffff:127.0.0.1 ...
--exec $MYSQLADMIN --no-defaults --default-character-set=latin1 -h ::ffff:127.0.0.1 -P $MASTER_MYPORT -u root ping 

--echo # Checking 127.0.0.1 ...
--exec $MYSQLADMIN --no-defaults --default-character-set=latin1 -h 127.0.0.1 -P $MASTER_MYPORT -u root ping 

# NOTE: ::1 has nothing to do with ::ffff:127.0.0.1, so the server bound to
# ::ffff:127.0.0.1 will not accept connections from to ::1.
