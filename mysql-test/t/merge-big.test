--echo # Bug#26379 - Combination of FLUSH TABLE and REPAIR TABLE
--echo #             corrupts a MERGE table
--echo # Problem #3
--echo #
# Two FLUSH TABLES within a LOCK TABLES segment could invalidate the lock.
# This did *not* require a MERGE table.
#
# To increase reproducibility it was necessary to enter a sleep of 2
# seconds at the end of wait_for_tables() after unlock of LOCK_open. In
# 5.0 and 5.1 the sleep must be inserted in open_and_lock_tables() after
# open_tables() instead. wait_for_tables() is not used in this case. The
# problem was that FLUSH TABLES releases LOCK_open while having unlocked
# and closed all tables. When this happened while a thread was in the
# loop in mysql_lock_tables() right after wait_for_tables()
# (open_tables()) and before retrying to lock, the thread got the lock.
# And it did not notice that the table needed a refresh after the
# [re-]open. So it executed its statement on the table.
#
# The first FLUSH TABLES kicked the INSERT out of thr_multi_lock() and
# let it wait in wait_for_tables() (open_table()). The second FLUSH
# TABLES must happen while the INSERT was on its way from
# wait_for_tables() (open_table()) to the next call of thr_multi_lock().
# This needed to be supported by a sleep to make it repeatable.
