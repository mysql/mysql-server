# Test KILL and KILL QUERY statements.

# Killing a connection in an embedded server does not work like in a normal
# server, if it is waiting for a new statement. In an embedded server, the
# connection does not read() from a socket, but returns control to the
# application. 'mysqltest' does not handle the kill request.
