# Bug#41486 extra character appears in BLOB for every ~40Mb after
#           mysqldump/import
#
# This test consumes a significant amount of resources.
# Therefore it should be kept separated from other tests.
# Otherwise we might suffer from problems like
# Bug#43801 mysql.test takes too long, fails due to expired timeout
#           on debx86-b in PB
