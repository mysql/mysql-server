# File::Path::rmtree has a problem with deleting files and directories
# where it hasn't got read permission.
#
# Patch this by installing a 'rmtree' function in local scope that first
# chmod all files to 0777 before calling the original rmtree function.
#
# This is almost gone in version 1.08 of File::Path, but unfortunately
# some hosts still suffers from this also in 1.08.
