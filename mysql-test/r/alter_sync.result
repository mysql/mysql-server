# Create a new connection.
connect  con1, localhost, root,,;
# Create a table and Alter it, but stop executing right before the
# object is stored persistently.
CREATE TABLE t1 (pk INTEGER PRIMARY KEY);
SET DEBUG_SYNC= 'before_storing_dd_object SIGNAL before_store WAIT_FOR cont';
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD fld1 INT, ALGORITHM=INPLACE;
connection default;
# From the default connection, get the thread id of the rename, and
# kill the query.
SET DEBUG_SYNC= 'now WAIT_FOR before_store';
SELECT ID FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST WHERE INFO LIKE "ALTER TABLE%" INTO @thread_id;

# Though KILL QUERY is executed when ALTER TABLE's THD is in the kill immune mode,
# killed status for THD is set only while exiting from the kill immune mode.
# Code checking THD::killed status outside kill immune mode reports an error.
