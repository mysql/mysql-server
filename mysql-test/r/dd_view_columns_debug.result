# Bug#26322203 - SHOW FIELDS FROM A VALID VIEW FAILS WITH AN INVALID VIEW ERROR
#
CREATE TABLE t1 (f1 int);
CREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT * FROM t1;
# Wait after listing view "v1" referencing table "t1" for state update.
SET DEBUG_SYNC="after_preparing_view_tables_list SIGNAL alter_view WAIT_FOR go";
DROP TABLE t1;;
connect  con1, localhost, root,,;
SET DEBUG_SYNC='now WAIT_FOR alter_view';
# Before state of the view v1 is updated ALTER view so that v1 is no more
# dependent on the table t1 being dropped.
ALTER VIEW v1 AS select 13;
SET DEBUG_SYNC='now SIGNAL go';
connection default;
# Without fix even if v1 is not dependent table/view or stored function
# being dropped because of concurrent DDL operation on the view v1, state
# of the view is updated as invalid.
#
# With fix, while updating view state if view is no more dependent on
# the object being dropped then view state is *not* updated.
FLUSH TABLES;
# Without fix, SHOW FIELDS from valid view "v1" reports invalid view error.
