Now let us also lock table explicitly and drop it.
lock tables t1 write, v_bug5719 write;
drop table t1;

unlock tables;
drop view v_bug5719;

When limitation to use temporary tables in views is removed, please
add a test that shows what happens under LOCK TABLES when a view
references a temporary table, is locked, and the underlying table
is dropped.

create view v_bug5719 as select * from t2;
ERROR HY000: View's SELECT refers to a temporary table 't2'

Cleanup.
