The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults Don't read default options from any option file.
--defaults-file=# Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read.

 --allow-suspicious-udfs 
 Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
 without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
 also means that one can load any function from any
 library, for example exit() from libc.so
 -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
 will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
 --auto-increment-increment[=#]

 have. This comes into play when the main MySQL thread
 gets very many connection requests in a very short time

 Tells the master to annotate RBR events with the
 statement that caused these events

 events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
 CRC32; default is NONE.
 --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates

 statement format to be written directly to binary log.
 Before using this option make sure that there are no
 dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
 tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam

 database, and exclude all others not explicitly
 mentioned.
 --binlog-format=name 
 What form of binary logging the master will use: either

 statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
 statement-based binary logging except for those
 statements where only row-based is correct: those which
 involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
 function; for those, row-based binary logging is
 automatically used. If NDBCLUSTER is enabled and
 binlog-format is MIXED, the format switches to row-based
 and back implicitly per each query accessing an
 NDBCLUSTER table

 Tells the master that updates to the given database
 should not be logged to the binary log.

 change it.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-optimize-thread-scheduling to disable.)
 --binlog-row-event-max-size=#

 bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
 size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.

 database. To specify more than one database to ignore,
 use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
 This option will not work if you use cross database
 updates. If you need cross database updates to work, make
 sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
 replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%. 
 --replicate-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
 table. To specify more than one table to ignore, use the
 directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
 work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
 replicate-ignore-db.
 --replicate-rewrite-db=name 
 Updates to a database with a different name than the
 original. Example:
 replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name->slave_db_name.
 --replicate-same-server-id 
 In replication, if set to 1, do not skip events having
 our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
 loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
 --log-slave-updates is used.
 --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
 specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
 updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
 and whose table names start with bar.
 --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
 that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
 than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
 to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
 table names start with bar.
 --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to the master
 during slave registration. Will appear in the output of
 SHOW SLAVE HOSTS. Leave unset if you do not want the
 slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is
 not sufficient for the master to simply read the IP of
 the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to
 NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid
 for connecting to the slave from the master or other
 hosts
 --report-password=name 
 The account password of the slave to be reported to the
 master during slave registration
 --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master
 during slave registration. Set it only if the slave is
 listening on a non-default port or if you have a special
 tunnel from the master or other clients to the slave. If
 not sure, leave this option unset
 --report-user=name  The account user name of the slave to be reported to the
 master during slave registration

 Show user and password in SHOW SLAVE HOSTS on this
 master.
 --skip-bdb          Deprecated option; Exist only for compatiblity with old
 my.cnf files
 --skip-grant-tables Start without grant tables. This gives all users FULL
 ACCESS to all tables.
 --skip-host-cache   Don't cache host names.
 --skip-name-resolve Don't resolve hostnames. All hostnames are IP's or
 'localhost'.
 --skip-networking   Don't allow connection with TCP/IP
 --skip-show-database 
 Don't allow 'SHOW DATABASE' commands
 --skip-slave-start  If set, slave is not autostarted.
 --skip-thread-priority 
 Don't give threads different priorities. This option is
 deprecated because it has no effect; the implied behavior
 is already the default.
 --slave-compressed-protocol 
 Use compression on master/slave protocol
 --slave-exec-mode=name 
 Modes for how replication events should be executed.
 Legal values are STRICT (default) and IDEMPOTENT. In
 IDEMPOTENT mode, replication will not stop for operations
 that are idempotent. In STRICT mode, replication will
 stop on any unexpected difference between the master and
 the slave
 --slave-load-tmpdir=name 
 The location where the slave should put its temporary
 files when replicating a LOAD DATA INFILE command
 --slave-max-allowed-packet=# 
 The maximum packet length to sent successfully from the
 master to slave.

 Number of seconds to wait for more data from a
 master/slave connection before aborting the read
 --slave-skip-errors=name 
 Tells the slave thread to continue replication when a
 query event returns an error from the provided list
 --slave-sql-verify-checksum 
 Force checksum verification of replication events after
 reading them from relay log. Note: Events are always
 checksum-verified by slave on receiving them from the
 network before writing them to the relay log
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-slave-sql-verify-checksum to disable.)
 --slave-transaction-retries=# 
 Number of times the slave SQL thread will retry a
 transaction in case it failed with a deadlock or elapsed
 lock wait timeout, before giving up and stopping
 --slave-type-conversions=name 
 Set of slave type conversions that are enabled. Legal
 values are: ALL_LOSSY to enable lossy conversions and
 ALL_NON_LOSSY to enable non-lossy conversions. If the
 variable is assigned the empty set, no conversions are
 allowed and it is expected that the types match exactly.
 --slow-launch-time=# 
 If creating the thread takes longer than this value (in
 seconds), the Slow_launch_threads counter will be
 incremented
 --slow-query-log    Log slow queries to a table or log file. Defaults logging
 to a file 'hostname'-slow.log or a table mysql.slow_log
 if --log-output=TABLE is used. Must be enabled to

 --sync-binlog=#     Synchronously flush binary log to disk after every #th
 event. Use 0 (default) to disable synchronous flushing
 --sync-frm          Sync .frm files to disk on creation
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-sync-frm to disable.)
 --sync-master-info=# 
 Synchronously flush master info to disk after every #th
 event. Use 0 (default) to disable synchronous flushing
 --sync-relay-log=#  Synchronously flush relay log to disk after every #th
 event. Use 0 (default) to disable synchronous flushing
 --sync-relay-log-info=# 
 Synchronously flush relay log info to disk after every
 #th transaction. Use 0 (default) to disable synchronous
 flushing
 --sysdate-is-now    Non-default option to alias SYSDATE() to NOW() to make it
 safe-replicable. Since 5.0, SYSDATE() returns a `dynamic'
 value different for different invocations, even within
 the same statement.

 Default transaction isolation level.
 --transaction-prealloc-size=# 
 Persistent buffer for transactions to be stored in binary
 log
 --updatable-views-with-limit=name

 VIEW without presence of a key of the underlying table is
 used in queries with a LIMIT clause for updating. NO =
 Prohibit update of a VIEW, which does not contain a key
 of the underlying table and the query uses a LIMIT clause
 (usually get from GUI tools)
