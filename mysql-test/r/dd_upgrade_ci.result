# Bug#29917793: REJECT UPGRADE 8.0.14-16 -> 8.0.17 FOR LCTN=1 AND PARTITIONED TABLES
#
# This is the test case for case insensitive file systems. A corresponding test case
# for case sensitive file systems can be found in dd_upgrade_cs.test.
#
# Test with lctn=1 and no partitioned tables. Upgrade should succeed.
# Set different path for --datadir and check that it exists.
# Upgrade the server.
# restart: --datadir=MYSQLD_DATADIR --log-error=MYSQLD_LOG --lower_case_table_names=1
# Stop the server and do cleanup.
# Test with lctn=1 and partitioned tables. Upgrade should succeed since we are on a

# Table rebuild will succeed.
