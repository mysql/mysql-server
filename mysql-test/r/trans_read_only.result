# Test 10: SET TRANSACTION / START TRANSACTION + implicit commit.
SET SESSION TRANSACTION READ WRITE;
SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
# Since DDL does implicit commit before starting, SET TRANSACTION
# will have no effect because the "next" transaction will already
# be over before the DDL statement starts.
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT);
START TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
# The same happens with START TRANSACTION
DROP TABLE t1;
