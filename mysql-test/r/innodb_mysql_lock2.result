# Test how do we handle locking in various cases when
# we read data from InnoDB tables.
#
# In fact by performing this test we check two things:
# 1) That SQL-layer correctly determine type of thr_lock.c
#    lock to be acquired/passed to InnoDB engine.
# 2) That InnoDB engine correctly interprets this lock
#    type and takes necessary row locks or does not
#    take them if they are not necessary.
#
# This test makes sense only in REPEATABLE-READ mode as
# in SERIALIZABLE mode all statements that read data take
# shared lock on them to enforce its semantics.

# Set common variables to be used by scripts called below.
#
#
# 1. Statements that read tables and do not use subqueries.
#
#
# 1.1 Simple SELECT statement.
#
# No locks are necessary as this statement won't be written
# to the binary log and InnoDB supports snapshots.
Success: 'select * from t1' doesn't take row locks on 't1'.
#
# 1.2 Multi-UPDATE statement.
#
# Has to take shared locks on rows in the table being read as this
# statement will be written to the binary log and therefore should
# be serialized with concurrent statements.
Success: 'update t2, t1 set j= j - 1 where i = j' takes shared row locks on 't1'.

# 2. Statements which read tables through subqueries.
#
#
# 2.1 CALL with a subquery.
# 
# A strong lock is not necessary as this statement is not written to
# the binary log as a whole (it is written statement-by-statement) and

# Locks are not necessary as this statement is not written
# to the binary log and thanks to MVCC we can always get
# versions of rows prior to the update that has locked them.
#
# Also serves as a test case for bug #46947 "Embedded SELECT
# without FOR UPDATE is causing a lock".
Success: 'select * from t2 where j in (select i from t1)' doesn't take row locks on 't1'.
#
# 2.10 SET with a subquery.
#
# In theory should not require locking as it is not written
# to the binary log. In practice InnoDB acquires shared row
# locks.
Success: 'set @a:= (select i from t1 where i = 1)' takes shared row locks on 't1'.
#
# 2.11 SHOW with a subquery.
#

#
# 3. Statements which read tables through a view.

#
#
# 4.1 SELECT/SET with a stored function which does not 
#     modify data and uses SELECT in its turn.
#
# There is no need to take row locks on the table
# being selected from in SF as the call to such function

# it uses. Therefore it should take row locks on the data
# it reads.

#
# 4.3 SELECT/SET with a stored function which
#     reads and modifies data.

# it should be serialized with concurrent statements.
# Hence reads should take row locks.
Success: 'select f5()' takes shared row locks on 't1'.
Success: 'set @a:= f5()' takes shared row locks on 't1'.
#
# 4.7 SELECT/SET which uses a stored function which

#     a view.
#
# Calls to such functions won't get into
# the binary log and thus don't need row locks.

# Hence, reads should take row locks.
Success: 'select f8()' takes shared row locks on 't1'.

#
# 5. Statements that read tables through stored procedures.
