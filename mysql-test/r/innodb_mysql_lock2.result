# Test how do we handle locking in various cases when
# we read data from InnoDB tables.
#
# In fact by performing this test we check two things:
# 1) That SQL-layer correctly determine type of thr_lock.c
#    lock to be acquired/passed to InnoDB engine.
# 2) That InnoDB engine correctly interprets this lock
#    type and takes necessary row locks or does not
#    take them if they are not necessary.
#
# This test makes sense only in REPEATABLE-READ mode as
# in SERIALIZABLE mode all statements that read data take
# shared lock on them to enforce its semantics.

# Set common variables to be used by scripts called below.
#
#
# 1. Statements that read tables and do not use subqueries.
#
#
# 1.1 Simple SELECT statement.
#
# No locks are necessary as this statement won't be written
# to the binary log and InnoDB supports snapshots.
Success: 'select * from t1' doesn't take row locks on 't1'.
#
# 1.2 Multi-UPDATE statement.
#
# Has to take shared locks on rows in the table being read as this
# statement will be written to the binary log and therefore should
# be serialized with concurrent statements.

# 
# A strong lock is not necessary as this statement is not written to
# the binary log as a whole (it is written statement-by-statement) and

# Also serves as a test case for bug #46947 "Embedded SELECT
# without FOR UPDATE is causing a lock".
Success: 'select * from t2 where j in (select i from t1)' doesn't take row locks on 't1'.
#
# 2.10 SET with a subquery.

# In theory should not require locking as it is not written
# to the binary log. In practice InnoDB acquires shared row
# locks.
Success: 'set @a:= (select i from t1 where i = 1)' takes shared row locks on 't1'.

#
# 3. Statements which read tables through a view.
