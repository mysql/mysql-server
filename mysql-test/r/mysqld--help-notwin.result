 --abort-slave-event-count=# 
 Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
 replication.
 --allow-suspicious-udfs 
 Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
 without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
 also means that one can load any function from any
 library, for example exit() from libc.so

 will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.

 auto-increment-increment != 1

 have. This comes into play when the main MySQL thread
 gets very many connection requests in a very short time

 file (Solves most 'table full' errors)
 --bind-address=name IP address to bind to.
 --binlog-cache-size=# 
 The size of the transactional cache for updates to
 transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
 use transactions containing many statements, you can
 increase this to get more performance

 Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
 events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
 CRC32; default is CRC32.
 --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
 Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
 statement format to be written directly to binary log.
 Before using this option make sure that there are no
 dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
 tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
 SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
 from the master.
 --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
 database, and exclude all others not explicitly
 mentioned.
 --binlog-format=name 
 What form of binary logging the master will use: either
 ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
 statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
 statement-based binary logging except for those
 statements where only row-based is correct: those which
 involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
 function; for those, row-based binary logging is
 automatically used. If NDBCLUSTER is enabled and
 binlog-format is MIXED, the format switches to row-based
 and back implicitly per each query accessing an
 NDBCLUSTER table

 Tells the master that updates to the given database
 should not be logged to the binary log.

 order commits.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-order-commits to disable.)
 --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
 The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
 bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
 size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
 --binlog-row-image=name 
 Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
 'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
 columns in the before and after image are logged.
 'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
 whenever possible (eg, blob column was not changed or is
 not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
 equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
 the table) is logged in the before image, and only
 changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
 FULL).
 --binlog-rows-query-log-events 
 Allow writing of Rows_query_log events into binary log.
 --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
 The size of the statement cache for updates to
 non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you

 to log in a transactionally safe manner. Currently, the
 disallowed statements include CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE
 inside transactions, all updates to non-transactional
 tables, and CREATE TABLE ... SELECT.
 --eq-range-index-dive-limit=#

 of doing index dives for equality ranges if the number of
 equality ranges for the index is larger than or equal to
 this number. If set to 0, index dives are always used.

 exception for replication (slave) threads and users with
 the SUPER privilege
 --read-rnd-buffer-size=# 
 When reading rows in sorted order after a sort, the rows

 them as soon as they are no more needed
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-relay-log-purge to disable.)
 --relay-log-recovery 
 Enables automatic relay log recovery right after the
 database startup, which means that the IO Thread starts
 re-fetching from the master right after the last
 transaction processed
 --relay-log-space-limit=# 
 Maximum space to use for all relay logs
 --replicate-do-db=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 specified database. To specify more than one database,
 use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
 Note that this will only work if you do not use
 cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
 SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
 database. If you need cross database updates to work,
 make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
 replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
 --replicate-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 specified table. To specify more than one table, use the
 directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
 work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
 replicate-do-db.
 --replicate-ignore-db=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
 database. To specify more than one database to ignore,
 use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
 This option will not work if you use cross database
 updates. If you need cross database updates to work, make
 sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
 replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%. 
 --replicate-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified

 directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
 work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
 replicate-ignore-db.
 --replicate-rewrite-db=name

 original. Example:
 replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name->slave_db_name.
 --replicate-same-server-id

 our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
 loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
 --log-slave-updates is used.
 --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
 specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
 updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
 and whose table names start with bar.
 --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
 that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
 than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
 to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
 table names start with bar.
 --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to the master
 during slave registration. Will appear in the output of

 slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is

 the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to
 NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid
 for connecting to the slave from the master or other
 hosts
 --report-password=name

 master during slave registration
 --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master

 master during slave registration
 --safe-user-create  Don't allow new user creation by the user who has no
 write privileges to the mysql.user table.

 --secure-file-priv=name 
 Limit LOAD DATA, SELECT ... OUTFILE, and LOAD_FILE() to
 files within specified directory
 --server-id=#       Uniquely identifies the server instance in the community
 of replication partners
 --server-id-bits=#  Set number of significant bits in server-id

 master.
 --skip-grant-tables Start without grant tables. This gives all users FULL
 ACCESS to all tables.
 --skip-host-cache   Don't cache host names.

 --slave-rows-search-algorithms=name 
 Set of searching algorithms that the slave will use while
 searching for records from the storage engine to either
 updated or deleted them. Possible values are: INDEX_SCAN,

 --slave-skip-errors=name 
 Tells the slave thread to continue replication when a
 query event returns an error from the provided list
 --slave-sql-verify-checksum

 transaction in case it failed with a deadlock or elapsed
 lock wait timeout, before giving up and stopping
 --slave-type-conversions=name

 seconds), the Slow_launch_threads counter will be
 incremented
