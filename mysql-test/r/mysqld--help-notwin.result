--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=#
 Also read groups with concat(group, suffix)
--login-path=# Read this path from the login file.

 --abort-slave-event-count=# 
 Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
 replication.
 --allow-suspicious-udfs 
 Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
 without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
 also means that one can load any function from any
 library, for example exit() from libc.so
 -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
 will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
 --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
 Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
 --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
 Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
 auto-increment-increment != 1
 --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
 --automatic-sp-privileges 
 Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
 --avoid-temporal-upgrade 
 When this option is enabled, the pre-5.6.4 temporal types
 are not upgraded to the new format for ALTER TABLE
 requests ADD/CHANGE/MODIFY COLUMN, ADD INDEX or FORCE
 operation. This variable is deprecated and will be
 removed in a future release.
 --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can
 have. This comes into play when the main MySQL thread
 gets very many connection requests in a very short time
 -b, --basedir=name  Path to installation directory. All paths are usually
 resolved relative to this
 --big-tables        Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on
 file (Solves most 'table full' errors)
 --bind-address=name IP address to bind to.
 --binlog-cache-size=# 
 The size of the transactional cache for updates to
 transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
 use transactions containing many statements, you can
 increase this to get more performance
 --binlog-checksum=name 
 Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
 events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
 CRC32; default is CRC32.
 --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
 Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
 statement format to be written directly to binary log.
 Before using this option make sure that there are no
 dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
 tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
 SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
 from the master.
 --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
 database, and exclude all others not explicitly
 mentioned.
 --binlog-error-action=name 
 When statements cannot be written to the binary log due
 to a fatal error, the server can either ignore the error
 and let the master continue, or abort.
 --binlog-format=name 
 What form of binary logging the master will use: either
 ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
 statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
 statement-based binary logging except for those
 statements where only row-based is correct: those which
 involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
 function; for those, row-based binary logging is
 automatically used. If NDBCLUSTER is enabled and
 binlog-format is MIXED, the format switches to row-based
 and back implicitly per each query accessing an
 NDBCLUSTER table
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay=# 
 The number of microseconds the server waits for the
 binary log group commit sync queue to fill before
 continuing. Default: 0. Min: 0. Max: 1000000.
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-no-delay-count=# 
 If there are this many transactions in the commit sync
 queue and the server is waiting for more transactions to
 be enqueued (as set using
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay), the commit procedure
 resumes.
 --binlog-gtid-simple-recovery 
 If this option is enabled, the server does not open more
 than two binary logs when initializing GTID_PURGED and
 GTID_EXECUTED, either during server restart or when
 binary logs are being purged. Enabling this option is
 useful when the server has already generated many binary
 logs without GTID events (e.g., having GTID_MODE = OFF).
 Note: If this option is enabled, GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED and
 GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED may be initialized wrongly in two
 cases: (1) All binary logs were generated by MySQL 5.7.5
 or older, and GTID_MODE was ON for some binary logs but
 OFF for the newest binary log. (2) The oldest existing
 binary log was generated by MySQL 5.7.5 or older, and SET
 GTID_PURGED was issued after the oldest binary log was
 generated. If a wrong set is computed in one of case (1)
 or case (2), it will remain wrong even if the server is
 later restarted with this option disabled.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-gtid-simple-recovery to disable.)
 --binlog-ignore-db=name 
 Tells the master that updates to the given database
 should not be logged to the binary log.
 --binlog-max-flush-queue-time=#

 keep reading transactions before it flush the
 transactions to the binary log (and optionally sync,
 depending on the value of sync_binlog).
 --binlog-order-commits 
 Issue internal commit calls in the same order as
 transactions are written to the binary log. Default is to
 order commits.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-order-commits to disable.)
 --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
 The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
 bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
 size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
 --binlog-row-image=name 
 Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
 'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
 columns in the before and after image are logged.
 'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
 whenever possible (eg, blob column was not changed or is
 not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
 equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
 the table) is logged in the before image, and only
 changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
 FULL).
 --binlog-rows-query-log-events 
 Allow writing of Rows_query_log events into binary log.
 --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
 The size of the statement cache for updates to
 non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
 often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
 can increase this to get more performance
 --binlog-transaction-dependency-history-size=# 
 Maximum number of rows to keep in the writeset history.
 --binlog-transaction-dependency-tracking=name

 How long a INSERT DELAYED thread should wait for INSERT
 statements before terminating. This variable is
 deprecated along with INSERT DELAYED.

 trace), if variable is set to 1, repeats the structure's
 key (if it has one) near the closing bracket
 --enforce-gtid-consistency[=name]

 to log in a transactionally safe manner. Currently, the
 disallowed statements include CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE
 inside transactions, all updates to non-transactional
 tables, and CREATE TABLE ... SELECT.
 --eq-range-index-dive-limit=# 
 The optimizer will use existing index statistics instead
 of doing index dives for equality ranges if the number of
 equality ranges for the index is larger than or equal to
 this number. If set to 0, index dives are always used.

 or ON. OFF means that no transaction has a GTID.
 OFF_PERMISSIVE means that new transactions (committed in
 a client session using GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC') are not
 assigned any GTID, and replicated transactions are
 allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON_PERMISSIVE means
 that new transactions are assigned a GTID, and replicated
 transactions are allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON
 means that all transactions have a GTID. ON is required
 on a master before any slave can use
 MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1. To safely switch from OFF to ON,
 first set all servers to OFF_PERMISSIVE, then set all
 servers to ON_PERMISSIVE, then wait for all transactions
 without a GTID to be replicated and executed on all
 servers, and finally set all servers to GTID_MODE = ON.

 used, creation of a stored function (or trigger) is
 allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
 if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
 logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
 ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues
 do not exist and the binary logging cannot break, so you
 can safely set this to TRUE
 --log-bin-use-v1-row-events 
 If equal to 1 then version 1 row events are written to a
 row based binary log.  If equal to 0, then the latest
 version of events are written.  This option is useful

 --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
 specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:

 updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
 and whose table names start with bar.
 --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables

 the transaction).
 --sha256-password-proxy-users 
 If set to FALSE (the default), then the sha256_password
 authentication plugin will not signal for authenticated
