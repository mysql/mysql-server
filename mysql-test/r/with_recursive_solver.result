# null_if_done: gets NULL when process is finished,
# leftm: left member,
# rightm: right member,
# pivot_lines: comma-separated list of number of lines which have been used as
# "pivot" (i.e. substracted to other lines to zero their numbers and
# make some unknowns disappear).
# pivot_columns: similar.
# We must locate, in the current set of
# equations, a line/column which can be used as pivot; that is done by
# a first scalar subquery which fills user variables (named
# @cur_pivot*). If no pivot is found, the scalar subquery contains no
# rows so returns NULL which triggers the end of the algorithm.
# The second and third scalar subqueries use the @cur_pivot* set by the
# first scalar subquery block, to eliminate the unknown everywhere.
# Note that we're relying on the fact that the SELECT list items are
# evaluated left to right.
# If we had LATERAL derived tables, the pivot would be determined in a
# LATERAL derived table having outer references to the recursive
# table's columns, so we wouldn't need user variables.
