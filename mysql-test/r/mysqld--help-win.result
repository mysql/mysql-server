The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults Don't read default options from any option file,
 except for login file.
--defaults-file=# Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=#
 Also read groups with concat(group, suffix)
--login-path=# Read this path from the login file.

 --abort-slave-event-count=# 
 Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
 replication.
 --activate-all-roles-on-login 
 Automatically set all granted roles as active after the
 user has authenticated successfully.
 --admin-address=name 
 IP address to bind to for service connection. Address can
 be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or host name. Wildcard
 values *, ::, 0.0.0.0 are not allowed. Address value can
 have following optional network namespace separated by
 the delimiter / from the address value. E.g., the
 following value 192.168.1.1/red specifies IP addresses to
 listen for incoming TCP connections that have to be
 placed into the namespace 'red'. Using of network
 namespace requires its support from underlying Operating
 System. Attempt to specify a network namespace for a
 platform that doesn't support it results in error during
 socket creation.
 --admin-port=#      Port number to use for service connection, built-in
 default (33062)
 --allow-suspicious-udfs 
 Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
 without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
 also means that one can load any function from any
 library, for example exit() from libc.so
 -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
 will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
 --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
 Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
 --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
 Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
 auto-increment-increment != 1
 --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
 --automatic-sp-privileges 
 Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
 --avoid-temporal-upgrade 
 When this option is enabled, the pre-5.6.4 temporal types
 are not upgraded to the new format for ALTER TABLE
 requests ADD/CHANGE/MODIFY COLUMN, ADD INDEX or FORCE
 operation. This variable is deprecated and will be
 removed in a future release.
 --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can
 have. This comes into play when the main MySQL thread
 gets very many connection requests in a very short time
 -b, --basedir=name  Path to installation directory. All paths are usually
 resolved relative to this
 --big-tables        Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on
 file (Solves most 'table full' errors)
 --bind-address=name IP address(es) to bind to. Syntax: address[,address]...,
 where address can be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, host
 name or one of the wildcard values *, ::, 0.0.0.0. In
 case more than one address is specified in a
 comma-separated list, wildcard values are not allowed.
 Every address can have optional network namespace
 separated by the delimiter / from the address value.
 E.g., the following value
 192.168.1.1/red,172.16.1.1/green,193.168.1.1 specifies
 three IP addresses to listen for incoming TCP connections
 two of that have to be placed in corresponding
 namespaces: the address 192.168.1.1 must be placed into
 the namespace red and the address 172.16.1.1 must be
 placed into the namespace green. Using of network
 namespace requires its support from underlying Operating
 System. Attempt to specify a network namespace for a
 platform that doesn't support it results in error during
 socket creation.
 --binlog-cache-size=# 
 The size of the transactional cache for updates to
 transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
 use transactions containing many statements, you can
 increase this to get more performance
 --binlog-checksum=name 
 Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
 events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
 CRC32; default is CRC32.
 --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
 Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
 statement format to be written directly to binary log.
 Before using this option make sure that there are no
 dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
 tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
 SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
 from the master.
 --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
 database, and exclude all others not explicitly
 mentioned.
 --binlog-encryption Enable/disable binary and relay logs encryption.
 --binlog-error-action=name 
 When statements cannot be written to the binary log due
 to a fatal error, the server can either ignore the error
 and let the master continue, or abort.
 --binlog-expire-logs-seconds=# 
 If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
 binlog_expire_logs_seconds seconds; If both this option
 and expire_logs_days are set to non-zero  values, this
 option takes priority. Purges happen at startup and at
 binary log rotation.
 --binlog-format=name 
 What form of binary logging the master will use: either
 ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
 statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
 statement-based binary logging except for those
 statements where only row-based is correct: those which
 involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
 function; for those, row-based binary logging is
 automatically used. If NDBCLUSTER is enabled and
 binlog-format is MIXED, the format switches to row-based
 and back implicitly per each query accessing an
 NDBCLUSTER table
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay=# 
 The number of microseconds the server waits for the
 binary log group commit sync queue to fill before
 continuing. Default: 0. Min: 0. Max: 1000000.
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-no-delay-count=# 
 If there are this many transactions in the commit sync
 queue and the server is waiting for more transactions to
 be enqueued (as set using
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay), the commit procedure
 resumes.
 --binlog-gtid-simple-recovery 
 If this option is enabled, the server does not open more
 than two binary logs when initializing GTID_PURGED and
 GTID_EXECUTED, either during server restart or when
 binary logs are being purged. Enabling this option is
 useful when the server has already generated many binary
 logs without GTID events (e.g., having GTID_MODE = OFF).
 Note: If this option is enabled, GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED and
 GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED may be initialized wrongly in two
 cases: (1) All binary logs were generated by MySQL 5.7.5
 or older, and GTID_MODE was ON for some binary logs but
 OFF for the newest binary log. (2) The oldest existing
 binary log was generated by MySQL 5.7.5 or older, and SET
 GTID_PURGED was issued after the oldest binary log was
 generated. If a wrong set is computed in one of case (1)
 or case (2), it will remain wrong even if the server is
 later restarted with this option disabled.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-gtid-simple-recovery to disable.)
 --binlog-ignore-db=name 
 Tells the master that updates to the given database
 should not be logged to the binary log.
 --binlog-max-flush-queue-time=# 
 The maximum time that the binary log group commit will
 keep reading transactions before it flush the
 transactions to the binary log (and optionally sync,
 depending on the value of sync_binlog).
 --binlog-order-commits 
 Issue internal commit calls in the same order as
 transactions are written to the binary log. Default is to
 order commits.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-order-commits to disable.)
 --binlog-rotate-encryption-master-key-at-startup 
 Force binlog encryption master key rotation at startup
 --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
 The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
 bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
 size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
 --binlog-row-image=name 
 Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
 'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
 columns in the before and after image are logged.
 'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
 whenever possible (e.g. blob column was not changed or is
 not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
 equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
 the table) is logged in the before image, and only
 changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
 FULL).
 --binlog-row-metadata=name 
 Controls whether metadata is logged using FULL or MINIMAL
 format. FULL causes all metadata to be logged; MINIMAL
 means that only metadata actually required by slave is
 logged. Default: MINIMAL.
 --binlog-row-value-options=name 
 When set to PARTIAL_JSON, this option enables a
 space-efficient row-based binary log format for UPDATE
 statements that modify a JSON value using only the
 functions JSON_SET, JSON_REPLACE, and JSON_REMOVE. For
 such updates, only the modified parts of the JSON
 document are included in the binary log, so small changes
 of big documents may need significantly less space.
 --binlog-rows-query-log-events 
 Allow writing of Rows_query_log events into binary log.
 --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
 The size of the statement cache for updates to
 non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
 often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
 can increase this to get more performance

 Maximum number of rows to keep in the writeset history.
 --binlog-transaction-dependency-tracking=name 
 Selects the source of dependency information from which
 to assess which transactions can be executed in parallel

 Set the filesystem character set.
 -C, --character-set-server=name 
 Set the default character set.
 --character-sets-dir=name 
 Directory where character sets are
 --check-proxy-users If set to FALSE (the default), then proxy user identity

 statements pending. If so, it allows these to execute
 before continuing. This variable is deprecated along with
 INSERT DELAYED.
 --delayed-insert-timeout=# 
 How long a INSERT DELAYED thread should wait for INSERT
 statements before terminating. This variable is
 deprecated along with INSERT DELAYED.

 trace), if variable is set to 1, repeats the structure's
 key (if it has one) near the closing bracket
 --enforce-gtid-consistency[=name] 
 Prevents execution of statements that would be impossible
 to log in a transactionally safe manner. Currently, the
 disallowed statements include CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE
 inside transactions, all updates to non-transactional
 tables, and CREATE TABLE ... SELECT.
 --eq-range-index-dive-limit=# 
 The optimizer will use existing index statistics instead
 of doing index dives for equality ranges if the number of
 equality ranges for the index is larger than or equal to
 this number. If set to 0, index dives are always used.
 --event-scheduler[=name] 
 Enable the event scheduler. Possible values are ON, OFF,
 and DISABLED (keep the event scheduler completely
 deactivated, it cannot be activated run-time)
 -T, --exit-info[=#] Used for debugging. Use at your own risk.
 --expire-logs-days=# 
 If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
 expire_logs_days days; If this option alone is set on the
 command line or in a configuration file, it overrides the
 default value for binlog-expire-logs-seconds. If both
 options are set to nonzero values,
 binlog-expire-logs-seconds takes priority. Possible
 purges happen at startup and at binary log rotation.
 --explicit-defaults-for-timestamp 
 This option causes CREATE TABLE to create all TIMESTAMP
 columns as NULL with DEFAULT NULL attribute, Without this
 option, TIMESTAMP columns are NOT NULL and have implicit
 DEFAULT clauses. The old behavior is deprecated. The
 variable can only be set by users having the SUPER
 privilege.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-explicit-defaults-for-timestamp to disable.)
 --external-locking  Use system (external) locking (disabled by default). 
 With this option enabled you can run myisamchk to test
 (not repair) tables while the MySQL server is running.
 Disable with --skip-external-locking.

 compress the gtid_executed table every
 gtid_executed_compression_period transactions, as a
 special case, if variable is 0, the thread never wakes up
 to compress the gtid_executed table.
 --gtid-mode=name    Controls whether Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs)
 are enabled. Can be OFF, OFF_PERMISSIVE, ON_PERMISSIVE,
 or ON. OFF means that no transaction has a GTID.
 OFF_PERMISSIVE means that new transactions (committed in
 a client session using GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC') are not
 assigned any GTID, and replicated transactions are
 allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON_PERMISSIVE means
 that new transactions are assigned a GTID, and replicated
 transactions are allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON
 means that all transactions have a GTID. ON is required
 on a master before any slave can use
 MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1. To safely switch from OFF to ON,
 first set all servers to OFF_PERMISSIVE, then set all
 servers to ON_PERMISSIVE, then wait for all transactions
 without a GTID to be replicated and executed on all
 servers, and finally set all servers to GTID_MODE = ON.
 -?, --help          Display this help and exit.

 --log-bin[=name]    Configures the name prefix to use for binary log files.
 If the --log-bin option is not supplied, the name prefix
 defaults to "binlog". If the --log-bin option is supplied
 without argument, the name prefix defaults to
 "HOSTNAME-bin", where HOSTNAME is the machine's hostname.
 To set a different name prefix for binary log files, use
 --log-bin=name. To disable binary logging, use the
 --skip-log-bin or --disable-log-bin option.
 --log-bin-index=name

 --log-bin-trust-function-creators 
 If set to FALSE (the default), then when --log-bin is
 used, creation of a stored function (or trigger) is
 allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
 if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
 logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
 ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues
 do not exist and the binary logging cannot break, so you
 can safely set this to TRUE
 --log-bin-use-v1-row-events 
 If equal to 1 then version 1 row events are written to a

 --log-timestamps=name 
 UTC to timestamp log files in zulu time, for more concise
 timestamps and easier correlation of logs from servers
 from multiple time zones, or SYSTEM to use the system's
 local time. This affects only log files, not log tables,
 as the timestamp columns of the latter can be converted
 at will.
 --long-query-time=# Log all queries that have taken more than long_query_time
 seconds to execute to file. The argument will be treated
 as a decimal value with microsecond precision
 --low-priority-updates

 --sql-require-primary-key 
 When set, tables must be created with a primary key, and
 an existing primary key cannot be removed with 'ALTER
 TABLE'. Attempts to do so will result in an error.
 --standalone        Dummy option to start as a standalone program (NT).
 --stored-program-cache=# 
 The soft upper limit for number of cached stored routines
 for one connection.
 --stored-program-definition-cache=# 
 The number of cached stored program definitions
 --super-read-only   Make all non-temporary tables read-only, with the
 exception for replication (slave) threads.  Users with
 the SUPER privilege are affected, unlike read_only. 
 Setting super_read_only to ON also sets read_only to ON.
 -s, --symbolic-links 
 Enable symbolic link support (deprecated and will be 
 removed in a future release).
 --sync-binlog=#     Synchronously flush binary log to disk after every #th
 write to the file. Use 0 to disable synchronous flushing
 --sync-master-info=# 
 Synchronously flush master info to disk after every #th
 event. Use 0 to disable synchronous flushing
 --sync-relay-log=#  Synchronously flush relay log to disk after every #th
 event. Use 0 to disable synchronous flushing
 --sync-relay-log-info=# 
 Synchronously flush relay log info to disk after every
 #th transaction. Use 0 to disable synchronous flushing
 --sysdate-is-now    Non-default option to alias SYSDATE() to NOW() to make it
 safe-replicable. Since 5.0, SYSDATE() returns a `dynamic'
 value different for different invocations, even within
 the same statement.
 --table-definition-cache=# 
 The number of cached table definitions
 --table-encryption-privilege-check 
 Indicates if server enables privilege check when user
 tries to use non-default value for CREATE DATABASE or
 CREATE TABLESPACE or when user tries to do CREATE TABLE
 with ENCRYPTION option which deviates from per-database
 default.
 --table-open-cache=# 
 The number of cached open tables (total for all table
 cache instances)
 --table-open-cache-instances=# 
 The number of table cache instances
 --tablespace-definition-cache=# 
 The number of cached tablespace definitions
 --tc-heuristic-recover=name 
 Decision to use in heuristic recover process. Possible
 values are OFF, COMMIT or ROLLBACK.
 --temptable-max-ram=# 
 Maximum amount of memory (in bytes) the TempTable storage
 engine is allowed to allocate from the main memory (RAM)
 before starting to store data on disk.
 --temptable-use-mmap 
 Use mmap files for temptables
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-temptable-use-mmap to disable.)
 --thread-cache-size=# 
 How many threads we should keep in a cache for reuse
 --thread-handling=name 
 Define threads usage for handling queries, one of
 one-thread-per-connection, no-threads, loaded-dynamically
 --thread-stack=#    The stack size for each thread
 --tls-ciphersuites=name 
 --tls-version=name  TLS version, permitted values are TLSv1, TLSv1.1,
 TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3
 --tmp-table-size=#  If an internal in-memory temporary table in the MEMORY
 storage engine exceeds this size, MySQL will
 automatically convert it to an on-disk table
 -t, --tmpdir=name   Path for temporary files. Several paths may be specified,
 separated by a semicolon (;), in this case they are used
 in a round-robin fashion
 --transaction-alloc-block-size=# 
 Allocation block size for transactions to be stored in
 binary log
 --transaction-isolation=name 
 Default transaction isolation level.
 --transaction-prealloc-size=# 
 Persistent buffer for transactions to be stored in binary
 log
 --transaction-read-only 
 Default transaction access mode. True if transactions are
 read-only.
 --transaction-write-set-extraction[=name] 
 This option is used to let the server know when to
 extract the write set which will be used for various
 purposes. 
 --updatable-views-with-limit=name 
 YES = Don't issue an error message (warning only) if a
 VIEW without presence of a key of the underlying table is
 used in queries with a LIMIT clause for updating. NO =
 Prohibit update of a VIEW, which does not contain a key
 of the underlying table and the query uses a LIMIT clause
 (usually get from GUI tools)
 --upgrade=name      Set server upgrade mode. NONE to abort server if
 automatic upgrade of the server is needed; MINIMAL to
 start the server, but skip upgrade steps that are not
 absolutely necessary; AUTO (default) to upgrade the
 server if required; FORCE to force upgrade server.
 -u, --user=name     Run mysqld daemon as user.
 --validate-config   Validate the server configuration specified by the user.
 --validate-user-plugins 
 Turns on additional validation of authentication plugins
 assigned to user accounts. 
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-validate-user-plugins to disable.)
 -v, --verbose       Used with --help option for detailed help.
 -V, --version       Output version information and exit.
 --wait-timeout=#    The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a
 connection before closing it
 --windowing-use-high-precision 
 For SQL window functions, determines whether to enable
 inversion optimization for moving window frames also for
 floating values.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-windowing-use-high-precision to disable.)
