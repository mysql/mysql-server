 Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
 replication.

 will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.

 Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)

 Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
 statement format to be written directly to binary log.
 Before using this option make sure that there are no
 dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
 tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam

 statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
 statement-based binary logging except for those
 statements where only row-based is correct: those which
 involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
 function; for those, row-based binary logging is
 automatically used. If NDBCLUSTER is enabled and
 binlog-format is MIXED, the format switches to row-based
 and back implicitly per each query accessing an
 NDBCLUSTER table
 --binlog-ignore-db=name 
 Tells the master that updates to the given database
 should not be logged to the binary log.

 --replicate-do-db=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the

 cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
 SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
 database. If you need cross database updates to work,
 make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
 replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
 --replicate-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the

 directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
 work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
 replicate-do-db.
 --replicate-ignore-db=name

 --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
 specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
 updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
 and whose table names start with bar.
 --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
 that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
 than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
 to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
 table names start with bar.
 --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to the master
 during slave registration. Will appear in the output of
 SHOW SLAVE HOSTS. Leave unset if you do not want the
 slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is
 not sufficient for the master to simply read the IP of
 the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to

 for connecting to the slave from the master or other
 hosts

 query event returns an error from the provided list
 --slave-transaction-retries=# 
 Number of times the slave SQL thread will retry a
 transaction in case it failed with a deadlock or elapsed
 lock wait timeout, before giving up and stopping
 --slave-type-conversions=name 
 Set of slave type conversions that are enabled. Legal
 values are: ALL_LOSSY to enable lossy conversions and
 ALL_NON_LOSSY to enable non-lossy conversions. If the
 variable is assigned the empty set, no conversions are
 allowed and it is expected that the types match exactly.
 --slow-launch-time=# 
 If creating the thread takes longer than this value (in
 seconds), the Slow_launch_threads counter will be
 incremented
 --slow-query-log    Log slow queries to a table or log file. Defaults logging
 to a file hostname-slow.log or a table mysql.slow_log if
 --log-output=TABLE is used. Must be enabled to activate
 other slow log options
 --slow-query-log-file=name 
 Log slow queries to given log file. Defaults logging to
 hostname-slow.log. Must be enabled to activate other slow
 log options
 --slow-start-timeout=# 
 Maximum number of milliseconds that the service control
 manager should wait before trying to kill the windows
 service during startup(Default: 15000).
 --socket=name       Socket file to use for connection
 --sort-buffer-size=# 
 Each thread that needs to do a sort allocates a buffer of
 this size
 --sporadic-binlog-dump-fail 
 Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
 replication.
 --sql-mode=name     Syntax: sql-mode=mode[,mode[,mode...]]. See the manual
 for the complete list of valid sql modes
 --standalone        Dummy option to start as a standalone program (NT).
 --stored-program-cache=# 
 The soft upper limit for number of cached stored routines
 for one connection.
 -s, --symbolic-links 
 Enable symbolic link support.
 --sync-binlog=#     Synchronously flush binary log to disk after every #th
 event. Use 0 (default) to disable synchronous flushing
 --sync-frm          Sync .frm files to disk on creation
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-sync-frm to disable.)
 --sync-master-info=# 
 Synchronously flush master info to disk after every #th
 event. Use 0 (default) to disable synchronous flushing
 --sync-relay-log=#  Synchronously flush relay log to disk after every #th
 event. Use 0 (default) to disable synchronous flushing
 --sync-relay-log-info=# 
 Synchronously flush relay log info to disk after every
 #th transaction. Use 0 (default) to disable synchronous
 flushing
 --sysdate-is-now    Non-default option to alias SYSDATE() to NOW() to make it
 safe-replicable. Since 5.0, SYSDATE() returns a `dynamic'
 value different for different invocations, even within
 the same statement.
 --table-cache=#     Deprecated; use --table-open-cache instead.
 --table-definition-cache=# 
 The number of cached table definitions
 --table-open-cache=# 
 The number of cached open tables
 --tc-heuristic-recover=name 
 Decision to use in heuristic recover process. Possible
 values are COMMIT or ROLLBACK.
 --thread-cache-size=# 
 How many threads we should keep in a cache for reuse
 --thread-handling=name 
 Define threads usage for handling queries, one of
 one-thread-per-connection, no-threads, loaded-dynamically
 --thread-stack=#    The stack size for each thread
 --time-format=name  The TIME format (ignored)
 --timed-mutexes     Specify whether to time mutexes (only InnoDB mutexes are
 currently supported)
 --tmp-table-size=#  If an internal in-memory temporary table exceeds this
 size, MySQL will automatically convert it to an on-disk
 MyISAM table
 -t, --tmpdir=name   Path for temporary files. Several paths may be specified,
 separated by a semicolon (;), in this case they are used
 in a round-robin fashion
 --transaction-alloc-block-size=# 
 Allocation block size for transactions to be stored in
 binary log
 --transaction-isolation=name 
 Default transaction isolation level.
 --transaction-prealloc-size=# 
 Persistent buffer for transactions to be stored in binary
 log
 --updatable-views-with-limit=name 
 YES = Don't issue an error message (warning only) if a
 VIEW without presence of a key of the underlying table is
 used in queries with a LIMIT clause for updating. NO =
 Prohibit update of a VIEW, which does not contain a key
 of the underlying table and the query uses a LIMIT clause
 (usually get from GUI tools)
 -u, --user=name     Run mysqld daemon as user.
 -v, --verbose       Used with --help option for detailed help.
 -V, --version       Output version information and exit.
 --wait-timeout=#    The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a
 connection before closing it
