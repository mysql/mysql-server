The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults Don't read default options from any option file,
 except for login file.
--defaults-file=# Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=#
 Also read groups with concat(group, suffix)
--login-path=# Read this path from the login file.

 --abort-slave-event-count=# 
 Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
 replication.This option is deprecated and will be removed
 in a future version. 
 --activate-all-roles-on-login 
 Automatically set all granted roles as active after the
 user has authenticated successfully.
 --admin-address=name 
 IP address to bind to for service connection. Address can
 be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or host name. Wildcard
 values *, ::, 0.0.0.0 are not allowed. Address value can
 have following optional network namespace separated by
 the delimiter / from the address value. E.g., the
 following value 192.168.1.1/red specifies IP addresses to
 listen for incoming TCP connections that have to be
 placed into the namespace 'red'. Using of network
 namespace requires its support from underlying Operating
 System. Attempt to specify a network namespace for a
 platform that doesn't support it results in error during
 socket creation.
 --admin-port=#      Port number to use for service connection, built-in
 default (33062)
 --admin-ssl         Enable SSL for admin interface (automatically enabled
 with other flags).
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-admin-ssl to disable.)

 --admin-ssl-crlpath=name 
 --admin-ssl-key=name 
 --admin-tls-ciphersuites=name 
 --allow-suspicious-udfs 
 Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
 without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
 also means that one can load any function from any
 library, for example exit() from libc.so
 -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
 will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
 --authentication-policy=name 
 Defines policies around how user account can be
 configured with Multi Factor authentication methods
 during CREATE/ALTER USER statement. This variable accepts
 at-most 3 comma separated list of authentication plugin
 names where each value refers to what authentication
 plugin should be used in place of 1st Factor
 Authentication (FA), 2FA and 3FA method. Value *
 indicates any plugin is allowed for 1FA, 2FA and 3FA
 method. An empty value means nth FA method is optional.
 --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
 Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
 --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
 Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
 auto-increment-increment != 1
 --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
 --automatic-sp-privileges 
 Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs

 are not upgraded to the new format for ALTER TABLE
 requests ADD/CHANGE/MODIFY COLUMN, ADD INDEX or FORCE
 operation. This variable is deprecated and will be
 removed in a future release.
 --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can
 have. This comes into play when the main MySQL thread
 gets very many connection requests in a very short time
 -b, --basedir=name  Path to installation directory. All paths are usually
 resolved relative to this
 --big-tables        Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on
 file (Solves most 'table full' errors)
 --bind-address=name IP address(es) to bind to. Syntax: address[,address]...,
 where address can be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, host
 name or one of the wildcard values *, ::, 0.0.0.0. In
 case more than one address is specified in a
 comma-separated list, wildcard values are not allowed.
 Every address can have optional network namespace
 separated by the delimiter / from the address value.
 E.g., the following value
 192.168.1.1/red,172.16.1.1/green,193.168.1.1 specifies
 three IP addresses to listen for incoming TCP connections
 two of that have to be placed in corresponding
 namespaces: the address 192.168.1.1 must be placed into
 the namespace red and the address 172.16.1.1 must be
 placed into the namespace green. Using of network
 namespace requires its support from underlying Operating
 System. Attempt to specify a network namespace for a
 platform that doesn't support it results in error during
 socket creation.
 --binlog-cache-size=# 
 The size of the transactional cache for updates to
 transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
 use transactions containing many statements, you can
 increase this to get more performance
 --binlog-checksum=name 
 Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
 events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
 CRC32; default is CRC32.
 --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
 Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
 statement format to be written directly to binary log,
 after executing them and before committing the
 transaction. Before using this option make sure that
 there are no dependencies between transactional and
 non-transactional tables such as in the statement INSERT
 INTO t_myisam SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, replicas
 may diverge.
 --binlog-do-db=name Include only updates to the specified database when
 writing the binary log.
 --binlog-encryption Enable/disable binary and relay logs encryption.
 --binlog-error-action=name 
 When statements cannot be written to the binary log due
 to a fatal error, this option determines whether the
 server ignores the error and closes the binary log, or
 aborts.
 --binlog-expire-logs-auto-purge 
 Controls whether the server shall automatically purge
 binary log files or not. If this variable is set to FALSE
 then the server will not purge binary log files
 automatically.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-expire-logs-auto-purge to disable.)
 --binlog-expire-logs-seconds=# 
 If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
 binlog_expire_logs_seconds seconds; If both this option
 and expire_logs_days are set to non-zero  values, this
 option takes priority. Purges happen at startup and at
 binary log rotation.
 --binlog-format=name 
 The format used when writing the binary log. ROW writes
 each changed row in a binary format. STATEMENT writes SQL
 statements. MIXED writes SQL statements for most
 statements, and row format for statements that cannot be
 replayed in a deterministic manner using SQL. If
 NDBCLUSTER is enabled and binlog-format is MIXED, the
 format switches to row-based and back implicitly for each
 query accessing an NDBCLUSTER table. This option is
 deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay=# 
 The number of microseconds the server waits for the
 binary log group commit sync queue to fill before
 continuing. Default: 0. Min: 0. Max: 1000000.
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-no-delay-count=# 
 If there are this many transactions in the commit sync
 queue and the server is waiting for more transactions to
 be enqueued (as set using
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay), the commit procedure
 resumes.
 --binlog-gtid-simple-recovery 
 If this option is enabled, the server does not open more
 than two binary logs when initializing GTID_PURGED and
 GTID_EXECUTED, either during server restart or when
 binary logs are being purged. Enabling this option is
 useful when the server has already generated many binary
 logs without GTID events (e.g., having GTID_MODE = OFF).
 Note: If this option is enabled, GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED and
 GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED may be initialized wrongly in two
 cases: (1) All binary logs were generated by MySQL 5.7.5
 or older, and GTID_MODE was ON for some binary logs but
 OFF for the newest binary log. (2) The oldest existing
 binary log was generated by MySQL 5.7.5 or older, and SET
 GTID_PURGED was issued after the oldest binary log was
 generated. If a wrong set is computed in one of case (1)
 or case (2), it will remain wrong even if the server is
 later restarted with this option disabled.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-gtid-simple-recovery to disable.)
 --binlog-ignore-db=name 
 Exclude updates to the specified database when writing
 the binary log.
 --binlog-max-flush-queue-time=# 
 The maximum time that the binary log group commit will
 keep reading transactions before it flush the
 transactions to the binary log (and optionally sync,
 depending on the value of sync_binlog).
 --binlog-order-commits 
 Issue internal commit calls in the same order as
 transactions are written to the binary log. Default is to
 order commits.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-order-commits to disable.)
 --binlog-rotate-encryption-master-key-at-startup 
 Force binlog encryption master key rotation at startup
 --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
 The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
 bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
 size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
 --binlog-row-image=name 
 Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
 'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
 columns in the before and after image are logged.
 'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
 whenever possible (e.g. blob column was not changed or is
 not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
 equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
 the table) is logged in the before image, and only
 changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
 FULL).
 --binlog-row-metadata=name 
 Controls how much type information is written to the
 binary log when using ROW format. FULL causes all
 metadata to be logged. MINIMAL means that only metadata
 actually needed by replicas is logged.
 --binlog-row-value-options=name 
 When set to PARTIAL_JSON, this option enables a
 space-efficient row-based binary log format for UPDATE
 statements that modify a JSON value using only the
 functions JSON_SET, JSON_REPLACE, and JSON_REMOVE. For
 such updates, only the modified parts of the JSON
 document are included in the binary log, so small changes
 of big documents may need significantly less space.
 --binlog-rows-query-log-events 
 Allow writing of Rows_query_log events into binary log.
 --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
 The size of the statement cache for updates to
 non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
 often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
 can increase this to get more performance
 --binlog-transaction-compression 
 Whether to compress transactions or not. Transactions are
 compressed using the ZSTD compression algorythm.
 --binlog-transaction-compression-level-zstd=# 
 Specifies the transaction compression level for ZSTD
 transaction compression in the binary log.

 of doing index dives for equality ranges if the number of
 equality ranges for the index is larger than or equal to
 this number. If set to 0, index dives are always used.

 Enable the event scheduler. Possible values are ON, OFF,
 and DISABLED (keep the event scheduler completely
 deactivated, it cannot be activated run-time)
 -T, --exit-info[=#] Used for debugging. Use at your own risk.
 --expire-logs-days=# 
 If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
 expire_logs_days days; If this option alone is set on the
 command line or in a configuration file, it overrides the
 default value for binlog-expire-logs-seconds. If both
 options are set to nonzero values,
 binlog-expire-logs-seconds takes priority. Possible
 purges happen at startup and at binary log rotation.
 --explain-format[=name] 
 The default format in which the EXPLAIN statement
 displays information. Valid values are TRADITIONAL
 (default), TREE, JSON and TRADITIONAL_STRICT.
 TRADITIONAL_STRICT is only used internally by the mtr
 test suite, and is not meant to be used anywhere else.
 --explicit-defaults-for-timestamp 
 This option causes CREATE TABLE to create all TIMESTAMP
 columns as NULL with DEFAULT NULL attribute, Without this
 option, TIMESTAMP columns are NOT NULL and have implicit
 DEFAULT clauses. The old behavior is deprecated. The
 variable can only be set by users having the SUPER
 privilege.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-explicit-defaults-for-timestamp to disable.)
 --external-locking  Use system (external) locking (disabled by default). 
 With this option enabled you can run myisamchk to test
 (not repair) tables while the MySQL server is running.
 Disable with --skip-external-locking.

 GROUP_CONCAT()
 --group-replication-consistency[=name] 
 Transaction consistency guarantee, possible values:
 EVENTUAL, BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER, BEFORE, AFTER,
 BEFORE_AND_AFTER
 --gtid-executed-compression-period[=#] 
 Compress the mysql.gtid_executed table whenever this
 number of transactions have been added, by waking up a
 foreground thread (compress_gtid_table). This compression
 method only operates when binary logging is disabled on
 the replica; if binary logging is enabled, the table is
 compressed every time the binary log is rotated, and this
 value is ignored. Before MySQL 8.0.23, the default is
 1000, and from MySQL 8.0.23, the default is zero, which
 disables this compression method. This is because in
 releases from MySQL 8.0.17, InnoDB transactions are
 written to the mysql.gtid_executed table by a separate
 process to non-InnoDB transactions. If the server has a
 mix of InnoDB and non-InnoDB transactions, attempting to
 compress the table with the compress_gtid_table thread
 can slow this process, so from MySQL 8.0.17 it is
 recommended that you set gtid_executed_compression_period
 to 0.
 --gtid-mode=name    Controls whether Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs)
 are enabled. Can be OFF, OFF_PERMISSIVE, ON_PERMISSIVE,
 or ON. OFF means that no transaction has a GTID.
 OFF_PERMISSIVE means that new transactions (committed in
 a client session using GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC') are not
 assigned any GTID, and replicated transactions are
 allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON_PERMISSIVE means
 that new transactions are assigned a GTID, and replicated
 transactions are allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON
 means that all transactions have a GTID. ON is required
 on a source before any replica can use
 SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1. To safely switch from OFF to ON,
 first set all servers to OFF_PERMISSIVE, then set all
 servers to ON_PERMISSIVE, then wait for all transactions
 without a GTID to be replicated and executed on all
 servers, and finally set all servers to GTID_MODE = ON.
 -?, --help          Display this help and exit.
 --histogram-generation-max-mem-size=# 
 Maximum amount of memory available for generating
 histograms

 --log-bin[=name]    Configures the name prefix to use for binary log files.
 If the --log-bin option is not supplied, the name prefix
 defaults to "binlog". If the --log-bin option is supplied
 without argument, the name prefix defaults to
 "HOSTNAME-bin", where HOSTNAME is the machine's hostname.
 To set a different name prefix for binary log files, use
 --log-bin=name. To disable binary logging, use the
 --skip-log-bin or --disable-log-bin option.
 --log-bin-index=name 
 File that holds the names for binary log files.
 --log-bin-trust-function-creators 
 If set to FALSE (the default), then when --log-bin is
 used, creation of a stored function (or trigger) is
 allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
 if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
 logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
 ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues
 do not exist and the binary logging cannot break, so you
 can safely set this to TRUE. This variable is deprecated
 and will be removed in a future version.
 --log-bin-use-v1-row-events 
 If equal to 1 then version 1 row events are written to a
 row based binary log.  If equal to 0, then the latest
 version of events are written.  This option is useful
 during some upgrades.
 --log-error[=name]  Error log file
 --log-error-services=name 
 Services that should be called when an error event is
 received
 --log-error-suppression-list=name 
 Comma-separated list of error-codes. Error messages

 index to the slow log if it is open
 --log-raw           Log to general log before any rewriting of the query. For
 use in debugging, not production as sensitive information
 may be logged.
 --log-replica-updates 
 If enabled, the replication applier threads will write to
 this server's binary log.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-log-replica-updates to disable.)
 --log-short-format  Don't log extra information to update and slow-query
 logs.
 --log-slave-updates This option is deprecated. Use log_replica_updates
 instead.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-log-slave-updates to disable.)

 Log statements considered unsafe when using statement
 based binary logging. This variable is deprecated and
 will be removed in a future version.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-log-statements-unsafe-for-binlog to disable.)

 --log-throttle-queries-not-using-indexes=# 
 Log at most this many 'not using index' warnings per
 minute to the slow log. Any further warnings will be
 condensed into a single summary line. A value of 0
 disables throttling. Option has no effect unless
 --log_queries_not_using_indexes is set.
 --log-timestamps=name 
 UTC to timestamp log files in zulu time, for more concise
 timestamps and easier correlation of logs from servers
 from multiple time zones, or SYSTEM to use the system's
 local time. This affects only log files, not log tables,
 as the timestamp columns of the latter can be converted
 at will.
 --long-query-time=# Log all queries that have taken more than long_query_time
 seconds to execute to file. The argument will be treated
 as a decimal value with microsecond precision

 replication applier thread for row events. Allowed values
 are: ALL_LOSSY to enable lossy conversions, ALL_NON_LOSSY
 to enable non-lossy conversions, ALL_UNSIGNED to treat
 all integer column type data to be unsigned values, and
 ALL_SIGNED to treat all integer column type data to be
 signed values. Default treatment is ALL_SIGNED. If
 ALL_SIGNED and ALL_UNSIGNED both are specified,
 ALL_SIGNED will take higher priority than ALL_UNSIGNED.
 If the variable is assigned the empty set, no conversions
 are allowed and it is expected that the types match
 exactly.
 --replicate-do-db=name 
 Make replication applier threads apply only changes to
 the specified database. To specify more than one
 database, use the directive multiple times, once for each
 database. Note that this will only work if you do not use
 cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
 SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
 database. If you need cross database updates to work,
 make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
 replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
 --replicate-do-table=name 
 Make replication applier threads apply only changes to
 the specified table. To specify more than one table, use
 the directive multiple times, once for each table. This
 will work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
 replicate-do-db.
 --replicate-ignore-db=name 
 Make replication applier threads skip changes to the
 specified database. To specify more than one database to
 ignore, use this option multiple times, once for each
 database. If there are statements that update multiple
 databases, this will work correctly only when the source
 server uses binlog_format=ROW.
 --replicate-ignore-table=name 
 Make replication applier threads skip changes to the
 specified table.To ignore more than one table, use the
 option multiple times, once for each table. If there are
 statements that update multiple tables, this will work
 correctly only when the source server uses
 binlog_format=ROW.
 --replicate-rewrite-db=name 
 Make replication applier threads rename a database, so
 changes in one database on the source will be applied in
 another database on this replica. Example:
 replicate-rewrite-db=source_db_name->replica_db_name.
 --replicate-same-server-id 
 In replication, if set to 1, do not skip events having
 our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
 loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
 --log-replica-updates is used.
 --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
 Make replication applier threads apply changes only in
 tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
 specify more than one pattern, use the option multiple
 times, once for each pattern. If there are statements
 that update both tables that are included and excluded by
 the pattern, this will only work correctly when the
 source server uses binlog_format=ROW. Example:
 replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
 updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
 and whose table names start with bar.
 --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
 Make replication applier threads skip changes to tables
 that match the specified wildcard pattern. To specify
 more than one pattern, use the option multiple times,
 once for each pattern. If there are statements that
 update both tables that are included and tables that are
 excluded by the pattern, this will only work correctly
 when the source server uses binlog_format=ROW. Example:
 when using replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar%, the
 applier thread will not apply updates to tables in
 databases that start with foo and whose table names start
 with bar.
 --replication-optimize-for-static-plugin-config 
 Optional flag that blocks plugin install/uninstall and
 allows skipping the acquisition of the lock to read from
 the plugin list and the usage of read-optimized
 spin-locks. Use only when plugin hook callback needs
 optimization (a lot of semi-sync replicas, for instance).
 --replication-sender-observe-commit-only 
 Optional flag that allows for only calling back observer
 hooks at commit.
 --report-host=name  Hostname or IP that this replica will report to the
 source while initiating the replication connection. Will
 appear in the output of SHOW REPLICAS. Leave this unset
 if you do not want the replica to register itself with
 the source. Note that it is not sufficient for the source
 to simply read the IP of the replica off the socket once
 the replica connects: in the presence of NAT other
 routing features, that IP may not be valid for connecting
 to the replica from the source or other hosts.
 --report-password=name 
 The account password that this replica will report to the
 source while initiating the replication connection.
 --report-port=#     The port for connecting to the replica, which this
 replica will report to the source while initiating the

 listening on a non-default port or if you have a special
 tunnel from the source or other clients to this replica.
 If not sure, leave this option unset.
 --report-user=name  The account user name that this replica will report to
 the source while initiating the replication connection.

 (Defaults to on; use --skip-temptable-use-mmap to disable.)
 --terminology-use-previous=name 
 Make monitoring tables and statements use the identifiers
 that were in use before they were changed in a given
 release. That includes names for mutexes, read/write
 locks, condition variables, memory allocations, thread
 names, thread stages, and thread commands. When the
 session option is set to BEFORE_8_0_26, the session uses
 the names that were in use until 8.0.25, when it selects
 from performance_schema tables, or selects from
 INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST, or issues SHOW
 PROCESSLIST or SHOW REPLICA STATUS. When the global
 option is set to BEFORE_8_0_26, new sessions use
 BEFORE_8_0_26 as default for the session option, and in

 in a round-robin fashion
 --transaction-alloc-block-size=# 
 Allocation block size for transactions to be stored in
 binary log
 --transaction-isolation=name 
 Default transaction isolation level.
 --transaction-prealloc-size=# 
 Persistent buffer for transactions to be stored in binary
 log
 --transaction-read-only 
 Default transaction access mode. True if transactions are
 read-only.
 --transaction-write-set-extraction[=name] 
 This option is used to let the server know when to
 extract the write set which will be used for various
 purposes. 
 --updatable-views-with-limit=name 
 YES = Don't issue an error message (warning only) if a
 VIEW without presence of a key of the underlying table is
 used in queries with a LIMIT clause for updating. NO =
 Prohibit update of a VIEW, which does not contain a key
 of the underlying table and the query uses a LIMIT clause
 (usually get from GUI tools)
 --upgrade=name      Set server upgrade mode. NONE to abort server if
 automatic upgrade of the server is needed; MINIMAL to
 start the server, but skip upgrade steps that are not
 absolutely necessary; AUTO (default) to upgrade the
 server if required; FORCE to force upgrade server.

 connection before closing it
 --windowing-use-high-precision 
 For SQL window functions, determines whether to enable
 inversion optimization for moving window frames also for
 floating values.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-windowing-use-high-precision to disable.)
 --xa-detach-on-prepare 
 When set, XA transactions will be detached (AKA
 dissociated or disconnected) from connection as part of
 XA PREPARE. This means that the XA transaction can be
 committed/rolled back by any connection, even if the
 starting connection has not terminated, and the starting
 connection can start new transactions. As a side effect,
 temporary tables cannot be used inside XA transactions.
 When disabled, XA transactions are associated with the
 same connection until the session disconnects. ON is the
 only safe choice for replication.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-xa-detach-on-prepare to disable.)
