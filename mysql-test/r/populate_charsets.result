# Bug #22284224: REWRITE REPOPULATION OF CHARACTER SETS AND COLLATIONS DURING STARTUP
#
# Verify that new collations become available in the server
# after a restart. Verify that previously existing
# collations are deleted if they are not present in the
# character sets dir when restarting.
#
# New character sets dir:
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'character_sets_dir%';
Variable_name	Value
character_sets_dir	MYSQL_TEST_DIR/std_data/
#
# Show new collation available in the new character sets dir:
SHOW COLLATION LIKE 'utf8_phone_ci';
Collation	Charset	Id	Default	Compiled	Sortlen	Pad_attribute
utf8_phone_ci	utf8	352			8	PAD SPACE
#
# Create and drop a table using the new collation:
CREATE TABLE t1 (pk INTEGER) COLLATE utf8_phone_ci;
Warnings:
Warning	3778	'utf8_phone_ci' is a collation of the deprecated character set UTF8MB3. Please consider using UTF8MB4 with an appropriate collation instead.
SHOW CREATE TABLE t1;
Table	Create Table
t1	CREATE TABLE `t1` (
  `pk` int(11) DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_phone_ci
DROP TABLE t1;
#
# Restart server with original character sets dir:
# restart:--character-sets-dir=MYSQL_CHARSETSDIR
#
# Reverted to old character sets dir:
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'character_sets_dir%';
Variable_name	Value
character_sets_dir	MYSQL_CHARSETSDIR/
#
# The newly added collation has been deleted:
SHOW COLLATION LIKE 'utf8_phone_ci';
Collation	Charset	Id	Default	Compiled	Sortlen	Pad_attribute
#
# Create a table using the deleted collation, expected to fail:
CREATE TABLE t1 (pk INTEGER) COLLATE utf8_phone_ci;
ERROR HY000: Unknown collation: 'utf8_phone_ci'
