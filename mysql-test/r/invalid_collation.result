# Bug #22477433: TABLE WITH UNKNOWN COLLATION CRASHES MYSQL
#
# Create a table with a certain collation. Restart
# the server with a new --character-sets-dir where
# the collation is not supported. Verify that we
# can do DROP and RENAME TABLE, and that CHECK TABLE
# will report a warning.
#
# New character sets dir:
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'character_sets_dir%';
Variable_name	Value
character_sets_dir	MYSQL_TEST_DIR/std_data/
#
# Show new collation available in the new character sets dir:
SHOW COLLATION LIKE 'utf8mb3_phone_ci';
Collation	Charset	Id	Default	Compiled	Sortlen	Pad_attribute
utf8mb3_phone_ci	utf8mb3	352			8	PAD SPACE
#
# Create two tables using the new collation:
CREATE TABLE t1 (i INTEGER, a VARCHAR(10) COLLATE utf8mb3_phone_ci) COLLATE utf8mb3_phone_ci;
Warnings:
Warning	3778	'utf8mb3_phone_ci' is a collation of the deprecated character set UTF8MB3. Please consider using UTF8MB4 with an appropriate collation instead.
Warning	4162	'utf8mb3_phone_ci' is a user defined collation. User defined collations are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Consider using a compiled collation instead.
