# Part of test coverage for WL#9826 "Allow RENAME TABLES under
# LOCK TABLES" which needs debug build and debug_sync facility.
#
# The main part of coverage for this WL resides in rename.test.
# This file only contains subtests which require debug/debug_sync
# facilities, hence their odd numbering.
