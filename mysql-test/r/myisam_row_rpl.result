# Bug#11940249: RBR: MYISAM TABLE CORRUPTION AFTER FIRST LARGE INSERT
#               ON SLAVE
#
# Must have > 100 rows in the first rpl event (to trigger bulk_insert
# optimization for insert into an empty table, by disable all non-unique
# indexes and recreate them afterwards.)
# and then it must be a second rpl event for the same insert (i.e.
# during the same lock).
# Note that --binlog-row-event-max-size=1024 is set in the .opt files
# to enforce the default size.
