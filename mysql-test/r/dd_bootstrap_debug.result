#
# This file contains bootstrap test cases that
# need to be run with a debug build. See also the
# test file 'dd_bootstrap.test' for test cases
# that can be run with a non-debug server build.
#
# Preparation: Shut server down.
#
# 1. Try restart after setting an invalid version.
# ------------------------------------------------
# 1.1 Create bootstrap file.
# 1.2 First start the server with --initialize, and update the version.
# 1.3 Restart the server against DDIR - should fail.
# 1.4 Look for error.
#     Data Dictionary initialization error found 1 times.
# 1.5 Delete bootstrap file and datadir.
#
# 2. Try restart after dropping the properties table.
# ---------------------------------------------------
# 2.1 Create bootstrap file.
# 2.2 First start the server with --initialize, and drop the properties table. Should fail.
# 2.3 Look for error.
#     Data Dictionary initialization error found 1 times.
# 2.4 Delete bootstrap file and datadir.
#
# 3. Try restart after dropping the tables table.
# -----------------------------------------------
# 3.1 Create bootstrap file.
# 3.2 First start the server with --initialize, and drop the tables table: Should fail.
# 3.3 Look for error.
#     Data Dictionary initialization error found 1 times.
# 3.4 Delete bootstrap file and datadir.
#
# 4. Try restart after altering the schemata table.
# -------------------------------------------------
# 4.1 Create bootstrap file.
# 4.2 First start the server with --initialize, and alter the schemata table.
# 4.3 Restart the server against DDIR.
# 4.4 Connect as root.
# 4.5 Verify that the modified table is present.
SET SESSION debug= '+d,skip_dd_table_access_check';
SELECT t.comment FROM mysql.tables AS t, mysql.schemata AS s WHERE
t.name = 'schemata' AND
t.schema_id = s.id AND
s.name = 'mysql';
comment
Altered table
SET SESSION debug= '-d,skip_dd_table_access_check';
# 4.6 Shut server down.
# 4.7 Close the test connection.
# 4.8 Delete bootstrap file and datadir.
#
# 5. Try to access a DD table in an init-file during --initialize.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# 5.1 Create bootstrap file.
# 5.2 First start the server with --initialize, and submit the init file.
# 5.3 Look for error.
#     Data Dictionary table access error found 1 times.
# 5.4 Delete bootstrap file and datadir.
#
# 6. Try to access a DD table in an init-file during plain restart.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# 6.1 Create bootstrap file.
# 6.2 First start the server with --initialize.
# 6.3 Restart the server against DDIR with an init-file.
# 6.4 An init file error does not make the server exit, so we need to stop the server.
# 6.5 Look for error.
#     Data Dictionary initialization error found 1 times.
# 6.6 Delete bootstrap file and datadir.
#
# Cleanup: Restarting the server against default datadir.
