# Preparation: Shut server down.
# 1 First start the server with --initialize and --lower-case-table-names=1.
#   We need to make sure l-c-t-n is set during database initialization.
#   Otherwise the mysql.tables.name do not pick right collation.
#   This test also requires to be run with --character-set-server=utf8
# 2 Restart the server against DDIR
set names utf8;
create table `Ö` (id int);
show tables from test like 'Ö';
Tables_in_test (Ö)
ö
show tables from test like 'ö';
Tables_in_test (ö)
ö
drop table `Ö`;
# Shut server down.
#
# Cleanup: Restarting the server against default datadir.
