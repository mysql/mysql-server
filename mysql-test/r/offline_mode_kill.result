## WL#14317: Offline_mode: checks for SYSTEM_USER and CONNECTION_ADMIN privileges
##
## Define the following client types (only the last two can activate OFFLINE_MODE):
## - regular_session:  having SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN privilege
## - power_session:    having SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN and SYSTEM_USER privileges
## - super_session:    having SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN and CONNECTION_ADMIN privileges
## - sysadmin_session: having SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN, CONNECTION_ADMIN, SYSTEM_USER privileges
## Test that activating OFFLINE_MODE action performed by:
## 1. super_session kills regular_sessions, but not power_session or super_session or sysadmin_session
## 2. sysadmin_session kills regular_sessions and power_sessions, but not super_session or sysadmin_session
##
SET @original_offline_mode = @@global.offline_mode;

### Setup ###

# Create regular_session user
create user regular@localhost identified by 'regular';
grant SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN on *.* to regular@localhost;

# Create power_session user
create user power@localhost identified by 'power';
grant SYSTEM_USER, SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN on *.* to power@localhost;

# Create super_session user (switches off OFFLINE_MODE)
create user super@localhost identified by 'super';
grant SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN, CONNECTION_ADMIN on *.* to super@localhost;

# Create sysadmin_session user (max privileges)
create user sysadmin@localhost identified by 'sysadmin';
grant SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN, CONNECTION_ADMIN, SYSTEM_USER on *.* to sysadmin@localhost;

flush privileges;
# Create power_session connection
# Create regular_session connection
# Create super_session connection (switches off OFFLINE_MODE)
# Create sysadmin_session connection (max privileges)

## TEST 1: super_session activates OFFLINE_MODE

# Setup - create additional super_session connection
# Activate super_session connection
# Activate OFFLINE_MODE (with super_session)
SET GLOBAL OFFLINE_MODE=ON;
# Verify that the regular_session has been killed
SELECT USER();
ERROR HY000: Lost connection to MySQL server during query
# Verify that the power_session is kept alive
SELECT USER();
USER()
power@localhost
# Verify that the super_session is kept alive
SELECT USER();
USER()
super@localhost
# Verify that the additional super_session is kept alive
SELECT USER();
USER()
super@localhost
# Verify that the sysadmin_session is kept alive
SELECT USER();
USER()
sysadmin@localhost

## TEST 2: sysadmin_session activates OFFLINE_MODE

# Setup - activate super_session connection
# Setup - deactivate OFFLINE_MODE
SET GLOBAL OFFLINE_MODE=OFF;
# Setup - create additional regular_session connection
# Activate sysadmin_session connection
# Activate OFFLINE_MODE (with super_session)
SET GLOBAL OFFLINE_MODE=ON;
# Verify that the sysadmin_session did not kill itself
SELECT USER();
USER()
sysadmin@localhost
# Verify that the regular_session has been killed
SELECT USER();
ERROR HY000: Lost connection to MySQL server during query
# Verify that the power_session has been killed
SELECT USER();
ERROR HY000: Lost connection to MySQL server during query
# Verify that the super_session is kept alive
SELECT USER();
USER()
super@localhost

# CLEAN UP

DROP USER regular@localhost;
DROP USER power@localhost;
DROP USER super@localhost;
DROP USER sysadmin@localhost;
SET @@global.offline_mode = @original_offline_mode;
