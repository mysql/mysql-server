## WL#14317: Offline_mode: checks for SYSTEM_USER and CONNECTION_ADMIN privileges
##
## Each of the following clients can activate server OFFLINE_MODE:
## - regular_session:  having SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN privilege
## - power_session:    having SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN and SYSTEM_USER privileges
## - super_session:    having SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN and CONNECTION_ADMIN privileges
## - sysadmin_session: having SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN, CONNECTION_ADMIN, SYSTEM_USER privileges
## Test that activating OFFLINE_MODE action performed by:
## 1. regular_session only kills regular_sessions (including itself)
## 2. power_session kills regular_sessions and power_sessions (including itself), but not super_session or sysadmin_session
## 3. super_session kills regular_sessions, but not power_session or super_session or sysadmin_session
## 4. sysadmin_session kills regular_sessions and power_sessions, but not super_session or sysadmin_session

### Setup ###

# Create regular_session user
create user regular@localhost identified by 'regular';
grant SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN on *.* to regular@localhost;

# Create power_session user
create user power@localhost identified by 'power';
grant SYSTEM_USER, SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN on *.* to power@localhost;

# Create super_session user (switches off OFFLINE_MODE)
create user super@localhost identified by 'super';
grant SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN, CONNECTION_ADMIN on *.* to super@localhost;

# Create sysadmin_session user (max privileges)
create user sysadmin@localhost identified by 'sysadmin';
grant SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN, CONNECTION_ADMIN, SYSTEM_USER on *.* to sysadmin@localhost;
