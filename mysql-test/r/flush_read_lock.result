# FTWRL takes two global metadata locks -- a global shared
# metadata lock and the commit blocker lock.
# The first lock prevents DDL from taking place.
# Let's say that all DDL statements that take metadata
# locks form class #1 -- incompatible with FTWRL because
# take incompatible MDL table locks.
# The first global lock doesn't, however, prevent standalone
# COMMITs (or implicit COMMITs) from taking place, since a
# COMMIT doesn't take table locks. It doesn't prevent
# DDL on temporary tables either, since they don't
# take any table locks either.
# Most DDL statements do not perform an implicit commit
# if operate on a temporary table. Examples are CREATE
# TEMPORARY TABLE and DROP TEMPORARY TABLE. 
# Thus, these DDL statements can go through in presence
# of FTWRL. This is class #2 -- compatible because
# do not take incompatible MDL locks and do not issue
# implicit commit..
# (Although these operations do not commit, their effects
# cannot be rolled back either.)
# ALTER TABLE, ANALYZE, OPTIMIZE and some others always
# issue an implicit commit, even if its argument is a
# temporary table. 
# *Howewer* an implicit commit is a no-op if all engines
# used since the start of transactiona are non-
# transactional. Thus, for non-transactional engines,
# these operations are not blocked by FTWRL.
# This is class #3 -- compatible because do not take
# MDL table locks and are non-transactional. 
# On the contrary, for transactional engines, there
# is always a commit, regardless of whether a table
# is temporary or not. Thus, for example, ALTER TABLE
# for a transactional engine will wait for FTWRL, 
# even if the subject table is temporary.
# Thus ALTER TABLE <temporary> is incompatible
# with FTWRL. This is class #4 -- incompatible
# becuase issue implicit COMMIT which is not a no-op.
# Finally, there are administrative statements (such as 
# RESET SLAVE) that do not take any locks and do not
# issue COMMIT.
# This is class #5.
# The goal of this coverage is to test statements
# of all classes.
# @todo: documents the effects of @@autocommit,
# DML and temporary transactional tables.
# Use MyISAM engine for the most of the tables
# used in this test in order to be able to 
# check that DDL statements on temporary tables
# are compatible with FTRWL.

# 38) Test effect of auto-commit mode for DML on transactional

#
#       Let us demostrate this fact for some common DML statements.

# 39) Test effect of DDL on transactional tables.
#
# 39.1) Due to implicit commit at the end of statement some of DDL
#       statements which are compatible with FTWRL in non-transactional
#       case are not compatible in case of transactional tables.
#
# 39.1.a) ANALYZE TABLE for transactional table is incompatible with
#         FTWRL.

# Implicit commits are allowed under FTWRL.

# Reap ANALYZE TABLE
Table	Op	Msg_type	Msg_text

#
# 39.1.b) CHECK TABLE for transactional table is compatible with FTWRL.
#         Although it does implicit commit at the end of statement it
#         is considered to be read-only operation.
# Skip last part of compatibility testing as this statement
# releases metadata locks in non-standard place.
Success: Was able to run 'check table t3_trans' under FTWRL.
Success: Was able to run 'check table t3_trans' with FTWRL active in another connection.
#
# 39.2) Situation with DDL on temporary transactional tables is
#       complex.
#
# 39.2.a) Some statements compatible with FTWRL since they don't
#         do implicit commit.
#
# For example, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE:
Success: Was able to run 'create temporary table t4_temp_trans(i int) engine=innodb' under FTWRL.
Success: Was able to run 'create temporary table t4_temp_trans(i int) engine=innodb' with FTWRL active in another connection.
Success: Was able to run FTWRL while 'create temporary table t4_temp_trans(i int) engine=innodb' was active in another connection.
#
# Or DROP TEMPORARY TABLE:
Success: Was able to run 'drop temporary tables t3_temp_trans' under FTWRL.
Success: Was able to run 'drop temporary tables t3_temp_trans' with FTWRL active in another connection.
Success: Was able to run FTWRL while 'drop temporary tables t3_temp_trans' was active in another connection.
#
# 39.2.b) Some statements do implicit commit but are considered
#         read-only and so are compatible with FTWRL.
#
# For example, REPAIR TABLE:
Success: Was able to run 'repair table t3_temp_trans' under FTWRL.
Success: Was able to run 'repair table t3_temp_trans' with FTWRL active in another connection.
Success: Was able to run FTWRL while 'repair table t3_temp_trans' was active in another connection.
#
# And ANALYZE TABLE:
Success: Was able to run 'analyze table t3_temp_trans' under FTWRL.
Success: Was able to run 'analyze table t3_temp_trans' with FTWRL active in another connection.
Success: Was able to run FTWRL while 'analyze table t3_temp_trans' was active in another connection.
#
# 39.2.c) Some statements do implicit commit and not
#         considered read-only. As result they are 
#         not compatible with FTWRL.
#
flush tables with read lock;
# Implicit commits are allowed under FTWRL.

# Switching to connection 'default'.
# Reap ALTER TABLE
#
# 40) Test effect of implicit commit for DDL which is otherwise
#     compatible with FTWRL. Implicit commit at the start of DDL
#     statement can make it incompatible with FTWRL if there are
#     some changes to be commited even in case when DDL statement
#     itself is compatible with FTWRL.
#
# For example CHECK TABLE for base non-transactional tables and
# ALTER TABLE for temporary non-transactional tables are affected.
