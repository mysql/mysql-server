# Test that --basedir, --lc-messages-dir, --character-sets-dir
# and --plugin-dir are deduced correctly from the location of
# mysqld executable.
#
# Note that deduction of --character-sets-dir and --plugin-dir does
# not currently work correctly when running from a sandbox build dir,
# (the expected string is printed anyway to avoid diffs).
