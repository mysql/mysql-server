# Test how we handle locking in various cases when
# we read data from MyISAM tables.
#
# In this test we mostly check that the SQL-layer correctly
# determines the type of thr_lock.c lock for a table being
# read.
# I.e. that it disallows concurrent inserts when the statement
# is going to be written to the binary log and therefore
# should be serialized, and allows concurrent inserts when
# such serialization is not necessary (e.g. when 
# the statement is not written to binary log).
#
# Force concurrent inserts to be performed even if the table
# has gaps. This allows to simplify clean up in scripts
# used below (instead of backing up table being inserted
# into and then restoring it from backup at the end of the
# script we can simply delete rows which were inserted).
