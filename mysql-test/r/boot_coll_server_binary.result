# Bug#25054104 DATA DICTIONARY INITIALIZATION FAILS WHEN USING BINARY
# CHARSETS
#
# Some collation names must be quoted. E.g. the follwing fails:
CREATE SCHEMA s1 COLLATE binary;
ERROR 42000: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'binary' at line 1
# While this is ok:
CREATE SCHEMA s2 COLLATE 'binary';
# The collation used when creating the DD schema is taken from the
# startup option --collation_server, but was not quoted, which caused the same
# error as for s1 above. Fix is to add quotes (which is always safe).
# This test runs with --collation_server=binary and getting here, shows that it
# works.
DROP SCHEMA s2;
