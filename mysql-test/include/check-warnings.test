# when it does not happen. It will be changed when WL#7828 / WL#8003
# are merged in.

# Until that happens, we do 'SET SESSION AUTOCOMMIT = 1' here in order
# to commit that DD-RO-transaction that might be pending. Otherwise,
# the following statements will fail. By turning autocommit ON we
# achieve two effects:
#   1. Ensure there is no loose DD-RO-transaction (i.e. the effect of
#      COMMIT statement);
#   2. Make sure all future DD-RO-transactions that might happen below
#      will be properly committed.

# We set session variable to not affect other tests.
