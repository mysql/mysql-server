# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Setup $rpl_sync_chain, which is used by rpl_sync.inc. You normally
# don't need to source this file, it should only be sourced by
# rpl_sync.inc.
#
# $rpl_sync_chain is set to a string that specifies in what order
# servers should be synchronized in include/rpl_sync.inc. This has the
# form of a sequence of "chains" (with no separator between two
# chains). Each chain begins with $rpl_server_count_length space
# characters, followed by a sequence of numbers, each number
# whitespace-padded to $rpl_server_count_length characters. Each
# number in the sequence denotes a server, and the N'th server is a
# master of the (N+1)'th server. For example, if $rpl_topology is
# '1->2,2->3,3->1,2->4,5->6', then $rpl_sync_chain is ' 56 123124'.

# Algorithm:
# 0. Mark all servers as unseen and unsynced.
# 1. Let S be a server that is marked unseen.
# 2. Append S to the list of seen servers.
# 3. Check how S is marked:
#    3.1. If S has no master: append the list of seen servers (in
#         order from grand-master to grand-slave) to the end of
#         $rpl_sync_chain. Go to 3.
#    3.2. Elseif S is marked as synced: append the list of seen
#         servers (in order from grand-master to grand-slave) to the
#         end of $rpl_sync_chain. Go to 3.
#    3.3. Elseif S is marked as unsynced but seen: This means that the
#         graph of visited servers has a "6-shape": it is a loop with
#         a tail, such as 1->2->3->1->4->5. We should first sync the
#         loop, and then the tail. To ensure all servers in the loop
#         are synced, we must sync the loop two turns minus two
#         servers. For example, the loop 1->2->3->4->5->1 is fully
#         synced by this sequence of 1-step synchronizations:
#         1->2->3->4->5->1->2->3->4. Hence we do this: in the list of
#         traversed servers (in order from grand-master to
#         grand-slave), find the first occurrence of S. Take the
#         sub-list starting at the 3rd server and ending at the first
#         occurrence of S. Append this sub-list it to the end of
#         $rpl_sync_chain. Then append the entire list of traversed
#         servers (in order from grand-master to grand-slave) to
#         $rpl_sync_chain. Go to 3.
#    3.4. Else (i.e., S has a master and is not marked as seen or
#         synced): Mark S as seen. Set S=master(S) and go back to 2.
# 4. For each server that is marked as seen, mark it as synced.
# 5. If there are unseen servers, go back to 1.

# $_rpl_server_marks holds the marks of all servers. The i'th character
# corresponds to the mark of server i:
# '0' = unseen & unmarked, '1' = seen & unsynced, '2' = seen & synced.
