# Test ALTER TABLE with force of inplace rename
# - will try to perform the rename using inplace API
# - NOTE! caveat is that inplace API will only be used if there are
#   other changes to the table - else "simple rename" will be used
#   thus the test will add a column and rename table at same time
#
# Query will fail since ndbcluster returns HA_ALTER_INPLACE_NOT_SUPPORTED
# when mysqld asks if it supports inplace ALTER RENAME. Since user requested
# inplace, the query will be rejected by mysqld.
