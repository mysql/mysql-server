# Test behavior of ndbcluster and in particular the "ndb binlog thread"
# when its util tables are dropped from NDB.
# - the tables are vital for the functionality of binlog and schema distribution
# - currently there arte two util tables created by ndbcluster:
#  1) mysql.ndb_schema
#  -- communication between the MySQL Servers during schema distribution
#  -- hidden for both DDL and DML for a MySQL Server user
#  2) mysql.ndb_apply_status
#  -- keeps a record of the operations that have been replicated
#  -- currently not hidden for either DDL or DML for a MySQL Server user
# - if any of the tables are dropped from NDB, the "ndb binlog thread" will
#   have a "hickup", which means it will:
#  -- stop logging changes from NDB
#  -- write error message(s) to log file
#  -- tear everything down and restart itself
#  -- create the tables again
#

# Silence the expected errors written when "ndb binlog thread" is restarted
# due to the util table drop
