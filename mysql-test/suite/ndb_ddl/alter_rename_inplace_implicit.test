# Test ALTER TABLE with implicit inplace rename
# - will try to perform the rename using inplace API
# - NOTE! caveat is that inplace API will only be used if there are
#   other changes to the table - else "simple rename" will be used
#   thus the test will add a column and rename table at same time
#
# Query fails since ndbcluster does not yet support ALTER RENAME
# in combination with another change
