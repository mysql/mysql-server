# Testing replication delay reporting (bug#29309)
# there is an unavoidable non-determinism in the test

### bug emulation

connection master;

create table t1 (f1 int);
sleep 3;

#connection slave;

flush logs /* contaminate rli->last_master_timestamp */;

connection slave;

connection slave;
--echo # bug emulated: reports slave threads starting time about 3*3 not 3 secs

### bugfix


connection slave;
flush logs /* this time rli->last_master_timestamp is not affected */;
lock table t1 write;

connection master;
insert into t1 values (2);
sleep 3;

connection slave;
--echo # reports the correct diff with master query time about 3+3 secs

unlock tables;

connection master;
drop table t1;
