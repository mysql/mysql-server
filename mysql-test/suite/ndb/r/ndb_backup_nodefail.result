Setup error insert so that backup fails in a controlled way

Start backup, that will fail due to node failure
Check that node failure was controlled (e.g. node recovers)
Node recovered, ok
Clear error

Check backup ok
Setup error insert so that backup fails due to illegal signal
a) Error insert causes Backup 1 to set (restrict) signal scope
b) Backup 1 is run (succesfully) setting signal scope for BACKUP_REQ
c) Backup 2 is run subject to signal scope, and causes crash
in master data node when BACKUP_REQ is received from MGMD.
The expectation is:
- The master node will fail
- Other nodes will be unaffected

Run a backup (and set up error insert)
Start backup again, that will fail due to node failure
Check that node failure was controlled (e.g. node recovers)
Node recovered, ok
Clear error

Check backup ok
