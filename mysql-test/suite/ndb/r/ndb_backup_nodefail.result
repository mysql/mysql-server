Setup error insert to interleave DEFINE_BACKUP_REQ replies with NODE_FAILREP

Start backup, that will fail due to node failure
Wait for cluster to come up again

Setup error insert so that backup fails in a controlled way

Start backup, that will fail due to node failure
Check that node failure was controlled (e.g. node recovers)
Node 143: STARTED
Node 144: STARTED
Node recovered, ok
Clear error

Check backup ok
Setup error insert so that backup fails due to illegal signal
a) Error insert causes Backup 1 to set (restrict) signal scope
b) Backup 1 is run (succesfully) setting signal scope for BACKUP_REQ
c) Backup 2 is run subject to signal scope, and causes crash
in master data node when BACKUP_REQ is received from MGMD.
The expectation is:
- The master node will fail
- Other nodes will be unaffected

Run a backup (and set up error insert)
Start backup again, that will fail due to node failure
Check that node failure was controlled (e.g. node recovers)
Node 143: STARTED
Node 144: STARTED
Node recovered, ok
Clear error

Check backup ok
