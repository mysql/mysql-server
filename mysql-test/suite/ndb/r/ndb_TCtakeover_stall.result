A client holding a row lock can cause node restart
(CopyFrag) to stall until the row lock is released.

Check that a stalled CopyFrag does not lead to
TC takeover stall by :
- Restarting a node
- Stalling CopyFrag due to a rowlock
- Causing starting node failure
- Checking that TC takeover completes
(As transactions can be committed in
different epochs)
create table t1(id int primary key, val int) engine=ndb;
select count(*) from t1;

Starting the nowait node
Eventually it will be waiting for the lock above
Kill the starting node
This will result in TC takeover
Sleeping 10 s for node failure to be detected
and handling to start [and finish]
Test succeeded, no GCP stall
Release lock to allow data node start to succeed
rollback;
Wait for all data nodes to start
Started ok
drop table t1;
