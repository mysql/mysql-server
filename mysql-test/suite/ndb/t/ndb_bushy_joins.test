# ndb_bushy_joins.test
#
# This test is intended to check system behaviour when SPJ
# executes large bushy-joins, aka 'star-joins' -> joins with
# multiple childs being dependent on the same parent.
#
# These types of joins has previously caused 
# job buffer overflow as too many requests was
# sent in parallel from the SPJ block.
# (bug#14709490)
#
# '--replace_column 10 ### 11 ###' is used for explains throughout
# the test as experience has shown that 'rows' estimates
# may vary depending on OS, compiler and .. phase of moon.
