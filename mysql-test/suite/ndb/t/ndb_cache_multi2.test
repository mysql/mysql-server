# (*) Why we need to execute the query in non-ps mode.
# The principle of this test is: two mysqlds connected to one cluster,
# both using their query cache. Queries are cached in server1
# ("select a!=3 from t1", "select * from t1"),
# table t1 is modified in server2, we want to see that this invalidates
# the query cache of server1. Invalidation with NDB works like this:
# when a query is found in the query cache, NDB is asked if the tables
# have changed. In this test, ha_ndbcluster calls NDB every millisecond
# to collect change information about tables.
# Due to this millisecond delay, there is need for a loop ("while...")
# in this test, which waits until a query1 ("select a!=3 from t1") is
# invalidated (which is equivalent to it returning
# up-to-date results), and then expects query2 ("select * from t1")
# to have been invalidated (see up-to-date results).
# But when enabling --ps-protocol in this test, the logic breaks,
# because query1 is still done via mysql_real_query() (see mysqltest.c:
# eval_expr() always uses mysql_real_query()). So, query1 returning
# up-to-date results is not a sign of it being invalidated in the cache,
# because it was NOT in the cache ("select a!=3 from t1" on line 39
# was done with prep stmts, while `select a!=3 from t1` is not,
# thus the second does not see the first in the cache). Thus, we may run
# query2 when cache still has not been invalidated.
# The solution is to make the initial "select a!=3 from t1" run
# as a normal query, this repairs the broken logic.
# But note, "select * from t1" is still using prepared statements
# which was the goal of this test with --ps-protocol.
