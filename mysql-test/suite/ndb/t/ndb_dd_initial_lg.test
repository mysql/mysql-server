# BUG#11762867
# - show that system started with InitialLogFileGroup automatically allocated
#   extra reserved memory for use by the undo buffer
set @undo_buffer_pages = 20 * 32; # 20M / 32k pages
select (reserved > @undo_buffer_pages), (used>reserved) from ndbinfo.resources
  where resource_name = 'TRANSACTION_MEMORY'
    order by node_id;

# - show basic usability of the auto created log file group
create tablespace ts1
  add datafile 'data1.dat'
  use logfile group initial_lg1
  initial_size 20M
  engine = ndb;

create table t1 (
  a int primary key,
  b varchar(256)
) tablespace ts1 storage disk, engine = ndb;

insert into t1 values
 (1, "initial log file test");

drop table t1;
alter tablespace ts1 drop datafile 'data1.dat';
drop tablespace ts1;

# NOTE: Logfile group initial_lg1 is not dropped here since doing so leads
#       to check-testcase complaining about the removal of undofile1.log
#       and undofile2.log. These files are detected at the start due to
#       the creation of the initial logfile group
