## When a MySQL server starts up, it has to catch up on all the changes
## to NDB stored users as recorded in the ndb_sql_metadata table. The snapshots
## in the table include the output of SHOW CREATE USER. If the local result
## from SHOW CREATE USER is identical to the one stored in the snapshot, it
## can mark a user as synchronized without touching their password_last_changed
## timestamp.
##
## We are going to record some output from SHOW CREATE USER in the result file
## here, so that this test will fail whenever that output changes. Any time
## that output changes from one release to the next we should respond, either
## by writing code that expects the change, or by writing a release note to
## tell users that upgrading will cause password timestamps to get bumped.
