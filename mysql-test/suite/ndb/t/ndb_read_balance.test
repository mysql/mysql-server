# Potential TODO :
#   - Extend to cover FR
#   - Add hinted OI scan too ??  Requires composite primary key...
#   - Balance when Backup ! local
#   - Look at balance across nodes, LDMs, NGs etc...
#     For updates + reads
#   - Look at RB aspects, that we *do* RB
#     - Read *all* in one trans, expect some RB?
#     - Map rows to fragments to help?
#       - 2 node / NG-local reads, always local to node?
#       - NG !local reads, balanced?
#       - Map rows to 'Primary', 'Backup'  (row, primary node, backup node)
#       - Determine nodegroups (distinct (a<b:a:b), (a<b:b:a))
#       - Read rows in a single nodegroup...check purely local...
#   - FR?
