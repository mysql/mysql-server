# Test that old binlog formats can be read.

# Some previous versions of MySQL use their own binlog format,
# especially in row-based replication.  This test uses saved binlogs
# from those old versions to test that we can replicate from old
# versions to the present version.

# Replicating from old versions to new versions is necessary in an
# online upgrade scenario, where the .

# The previous versions we currently test are:
#  - version 5.1.17 and earlier trees
#  - mysql-5.1-wl2325-xxx trees (AKA alcatel trees)
#  - mysql-5.1-telco-6.1 trees (AKA ndb trees)
# For completeness, we also test mysql-5.1-new_rpl, which is supposed
# to be the "correct" version.

# All binlogs were generated with the same commands (listed at the end
# of this test for reference).  The binlogs contain the following
# events: Table_map, Write_rows, Update_rows, Delete_rows Query, Xid,
# User_var, Int_var, Rand, Begin_load, Append_file, Execute_load.

# Related bugs: BUG#27779, BUG#31581, BUG#31582, BUG#31583, BUG#32407

# It is required to supress BUG#21816447. It should be removed
# after the bug is fixed.

#USE test;

## ==== row based tests ====
#SET BINLOG_FORMAT='row';
#
## ---- get write, update, and delete rows events ----
#INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (0, 'one'), (1, 'two');
#UPDATE t1 SET a=a+1;
#DELETE FROM t1 WHERE a=2;
#
#
## ==== statement based tests ====
#SET BINLOG_FORMAT = 'statement';

## ---- get xid events ----
#BEGIN;

## ---- get user var events ----

## ---- get begin, append and execute load events ----
## double the file until we have more than 2^17 bytes, so that the
## event has to be split and we can use Append_file_log_event.
