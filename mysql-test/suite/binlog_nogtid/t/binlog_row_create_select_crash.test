# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that their is no crash any more while executing a
# 'CREATE...SELECT' statement even if it is interrupted at
# debug point 'mysql_lock_tables_kill_query' in the middle
# and 'CREATE TABLE' event was not logged when
# binlog_format='row', gtid_mode=off and autocommit=0.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Disable autocommit.
# 2. Create a table with select.
# 3. Drop the table from another connection.
# 4. Set DEBUG= '+d,mysql_lock_tables_kill_query'.
# 5. There is no crash while executing a 'CREATE ... SELECT'
#    statement even if it is interrupted at the above debug
#    point in the middle.
# 6. Verify that 'CREATE TABLE' event was not logged.
