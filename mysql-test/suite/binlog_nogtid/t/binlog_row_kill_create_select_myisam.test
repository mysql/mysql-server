# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that 'CREATE TABLE' event was not logged while killing a
# CREATE...SELECT right before writting 'create table' event into
# binlog statement cache, right after writting 'create table' event
# into binlog statement cache or after writting rows event into
# binlog transaction cache when binlog_format='row' and gtid_mode=off.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Execute a 'CREATE...SELECT', stop at several given sync points.
# 2. Kill the 'CREATE...SELECT' query from other connection.
# 3. Verify that 'CREATE TABLE' event was not logged.
#
