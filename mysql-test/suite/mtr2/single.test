# this suite is overlayed in heap and myisam.
# mtr2-heap has my.cnf, mtr2-myisam has suite.opt
# it means that all tests from the mtr2 suite will run
# three times - once for the parent suite, and once for each overlay.
# even if the test files are not overlayed.
#
# overlay.inc is overridden in mtr2-myisam, and there is an rdiff file.
