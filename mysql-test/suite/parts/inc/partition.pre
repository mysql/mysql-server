# ========================================================================
#
# 1. Explanation of the variables to be assigned in the top-level storage engine
#    specific scripts
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
#
# Options, for mostly test(script+logic+result) debugging support:
#     $debug= 0 (default)
#          --> The protocolling of auxiliary stuff is suppressed.
#              The file with expected results fits to this setting.
#     $debug= 1
#          --> All executed statements will be printed into the protocol.
#              That means statements which
#              - are most time of low interest and do auxiliary stuff
#                like generating the next SQL statement to be executed
#              - additional statements giving informations about table
#                contents or the value of some variables
#                You will get huge differences, because the file with the
#                expected results was created with $debug = 0 .
#
#     $with_partitioning= 1 (default)
#          --> Do the test with really partitioned tables.
#     $with_partitioning= 0
#          --> Do not use partitioned tables. This means omit the
#              "PARTITION BY ... SUBPARTITION BY ..." part of the CREATE TABLE
#              statement. This setting has only an effect on tests where
#              partition_methods1.inc and/or partition_methods2.inc are sourced.
#
#              You will get differences when the CREATE TABLE statements
#              and table related files are printed or testcases check
#              partition borders, but most server responses and result
#              sets should be usable as reference for the test with the
#              partioned tables.
#              Please make a run with $with_partitioning= 0, whenever
#              - you do not trust the scripts (routines checking server codes/
#                result sets)
#              - fear that there is a new bug affecting partitioned and non
#                partitioned tables
#
#
# Execute the test of "table" files
#     $do_file_tests= 1 (default for
#                        - all storage engines within the extended QA test
#                        - only MyISAM within the main regression tests)
#          --> Collect the file list and compare the file list before and after
#              OPTIMIZE/REPAIR/TRUNCATE
#     $do_file_tests= 0 (default for non MyISAM storage engines within the
#                        main regression tests)
#          --> Do not collect the file list.
#     Only MyISAM has files per PARTITION/SUBPARTITION, PRIMARY KEY, INDEX, ..
#     There is a low probability that this tests detects bugs when used in
#     connection with other storage engines.
#
# Option, for displaying files:
#     $ls= 1 (default)
#          --> Display the table related directory content via
#                "ls $MYSQLTEST_VARDIR/master-data/test/t1*"
#              if these informations were collected.
#              This is probably not portable to some OS.
#     $ls= 0
#          --> Omit displaying the directory
#
#
# Number of rows for the INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/SELECT experiments
# on partitioned tables:
#     @max_row is the number of rows which will be filled into the auxiliary
#     MEMORY table t0_template. This table is used for INSERT ... SELECT
#     experiments. The typical test table t1 contains most of the time
#     about @max_row DIV 2 rows.
#     Too small values of @max_row should be avoided, because some statements
#     should affect several rows and partitions.
#     Too big values of @max_row should be avoided, because of runtime issues.
#     @max_row= 20 (default for the main regression tests)
#              The file with expected results fits to this amount of rows.
#     @max_row= 300 (default for extended QA test)
#          --> Use <number rows>.
#              There should be only a few systematic differences to the file
#              with expected results, because most SQL statements use @max_row and
#              variables like max_row_div2 instead of a constant with the actual
#              number of rows.
#              I assume a value of 300 rows should be
#
#
# Perform the variant with extended tests:
#     $more_trigger_tests, $more_pk_ui_tests(PK=PRIMARY KEY,UI=UNIQUE INDEX),
#       =0 (default for the main regression tests)
#           - There is a very low probability, that the omitted tests reveal a
#             bug which cannot be detected with the other tests.
#           - Limiting the partitioning tests solves issues with runtime and
#             protocol size.
#       =1 (default for extended QA test)
#
#
# Perform PRIMARY KEY specific tests:
#     $do_pk_tests= 0;
#          --> Do not execute the PRIMARY KEY related tests.
#     $do_pk_tests= 1 (default for extended QA test)
#          --> Execute the PRIMARY KEY related tests.
#     The default setting for the main regression tests depends on the
#     storage engine. The PRIMARY KEY tests must be executed for every storage
#     engine, where the existence of a PRIMARY KEY affects the kind how the
#     table rows are stored.
#     Examples for the main rgression tests:
#       InnoDB - The PRIMARY KEY is a clustered index where the data for the
#                rows are stored.       $do_pk_tests= 1
#       NDB    - The PRIMARY KEY is used for implicit partitioning (NDB).
#                                       $do_pk_tests= 1
#       MyISAM - AFAIK there is no effect on the tree containing the rows.
#                                       $do_pk_tests= 0
#
# Assign a big number smaller than the maximum value for partitions
# and smaller than the maximum value of SIGNED INTEGER
# The NDB handler only supports 32 bit integers in VALUES
#     2147483647 seems to be too big.
#     $MAX_VALUE= (2147483646);
#
#
# 2. Typical architecture of a test:
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# 2.1. storage engine specific script on top level
#      (t/partition_<feature>_<engine>.test)
#      a) General not engine specific settings and requirements
#         $debug, $ls, @max_row, $more_trigger_tests, .....
#         --source inc/have_partition.inc
#      b) Engine specific settings and requirements
#         $do_pk_tests, $MAX_VALUE, $engine
#         SET SESSION storage_engine
#         $engine_other
#      c) Generate the prerequisites ($variables, @variables, tables) needed
#         via
#         --source inc/partition.pre
#      d) Set "fixed_bug<number>" variables to 1 if there are open engine
#         specific bugs which need worarounds.
#      e) Execute the feature specific testscript via
#         --source inc/partition_<feature>.inc
#      f) Perform a cleanup by removing all objects created within the tests
#         --source inc/partition_cleanup.inc
#
# 2.2. script generating the prerequisites needed in all tests
#      (inc/partition.pre)
#      a) Message about open bugs causing that
#         - some testcases are disabled
#         - it cannot be avoided that the file with expected results suffers
#           from open bugs
#           This should not occur often !
#           Example: There is extreme often an auxiliary testscript sourced,
#                    but the the conditions vary. We get under a certain combination
#                  of conditions a wrong result set or server response.
#      b) Set "fixed_bug<number>" variables to 0 if there are open engine
#         specific bugs. They are later set to 1 within the toplevel script.
#         Set "fixed_bug<number>" variables to 1 if there are open NOT engine
#         specific bugs.
#      c) Setting of auxiliary variables
#      d) Creation of auxiliary tables ....
#
# 2.3. script checking a feature
#      (inc/partition_<feature.inc>.inc)
#      Example:
#      a) "set/compute" a CREATE TABLE t1 .. and an ALTER TABLE ... statement
#      b) CREATE TABLE t1 ...
#      c) INSERT INTO t1 (.....) SELECT .... FROM t0_template WHERE ...
#         The first 50 % of all t0_template rows will be inserted into t1.
#      d) ALTER TABLE t1 (Example: ADD/DROP UNIQUE INDEX)
#      e) INSERT INTO t1 (.....) SELECT .... FROM t0_template WHERE ...
#         The second 50 % of all t0_template rows will be inserted into t1.
#      Now t1 and t0_template should have the same content.
#      f) Check the "usability" of the current table t1
#         via
#         --source inc/partition_check.pre
#      g) DROP TABLE t1
#      Switch to other CREATE and ALTER statements and run sequence a)-g) again
#      ...
#
# 2.4. script checking if a certain table shows the expected behaviour
#      ("usability" check):   inc/partition_check.inc
#      - SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE affecting single and multiple records
#      - check of values of special interest like NULL etc.
#      - INSERT/UPDATE with BEFORE/AFTER triggers
#      - violations of UNIQUE constraints, if there are any defined
#      - transactions ...
#      - TRUNCATE/OPTIMIZE/..
#      - ...
#
#
# 2.5. There are some auxiliary scripts with sub tests where we cannot predict
#      if we get an error and if we get one, which one.
#      Example: INSERT a record where the value for a certain column equals
#         some existing record.
#         Depending on existing/not existing PRIMARY KEYs, UNIQUE INDEXes
#         the response might be "no error", ER_DUP_KEY, ER_DUP_ENTRY.
#      Our requirements:
#      1. We cannot abort whenever get an error message from the server.
#      2. We want the exact server message into the protocol.
#      3. We want abort testing if we know that a certain error must not happen.
#      Common but unusable Solutions:
#      a) --error 0, ER_DUP_KEY, ER_DUP_ENTRY
#         <statment>
#         We get no error message even if the statement fails.
#      b) --error ER_DUP_KEY, ER_DUP_ENTRY
#         <statment>
#         We might get "got one of the expected errors".
#         There are situations where the statement must be successful.
#      c) --disable_abort_on_error
#         <statment>
#         --enable_abort_on_error
#         And nothing extra
#         We do not abort in case of unexpected server errors.
#
#      Final solution:
#         --disable_abort_on_error
#         <statment>
#         --enable_abort_on_error
#         Check via error number if the error is not totally unexpected.
#         The sub tests use $ER_DUP_KEY, $ER_DUP_ENTRY, etc.
#         Assignment of values happen in this file.
#
#
# 3. How to analyze a partitioning bug revealed with these tests/ How to build
#    a small replay script from the monstrous protocols ?
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# a) crash    -- use the file var/master-data/mysql/general_log.CSV
# b) no crash, but unexpected server response (there is no "reject file)
#             -- use the file r/<testcase>.log
#                Please be aware that the option $debug= 0 suppresses the
#                protocolling of some queries.
# c) no crash, but unexpected result set
#             -- use the file r/<testcase>.reject
#                Please be aware that the option $debug= 0 suppresses the
#                protocolling of some queries.
# In most cases you will find that the r/<testcase>.<log/reject> contains at
# least a line "#       # check <something>:       0".
# That means that a check within inc/partition_check did not got the
# expected result.
# A good start for a replay script would be
#   1. Copy t/partition_<feature>_<engine>.test to t/my_test.test
#   2. Edit t/my_test.test

# and reusing them in various combinations.
