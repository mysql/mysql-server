# Bug#12777 Different size shown for VARCHAR(n) columns (with n> 64)
#           in INFORMATION_SCHEMA
# This bug was unfortunately (for testers) declared to be no bug.
# So CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH of several <whatever>_CATALOG columns within
# the INFORMATION_SCHEMA depends on PATH_MAX of the operating system.
# Workaround for this problem:
# Get the size of ONE known colum and check the size against some values to
# be able to use the correct --replace_result statement. Using this only the
# one pair of 'wrong' values is replaced and not all occurrencies of all
# possible pairs of values. See bug #12777 for details.

FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'information_schema'
