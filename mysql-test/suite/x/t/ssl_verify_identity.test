# === Purpose ===
# This test verifies that while verifying the server certificates
# when ssl-mode=VERIFY_IDENTITY, the DNS/IPs provided in the Subject
# Alternative Names (which can be provided as an extension in X509)
# fields are also checked for apart from the Common Name in the subject.
# Applicable for openssl versions 1.0.2 and greater.
#
# === Related bugs and/or worklogs ===
# Bug #29691694 - LIBMYSQLXCLIENT --SSL-MODE=VERIFY_IDENTITY DOESN'T USE SUBJECT ALT NAMES
#
# Note that these test cases are written keeping in mind that the openssl version used by the system will
# be 1.0.2+. For older versions of openssl, the test will be skipped.
