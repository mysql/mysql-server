## Test for Bug#31742798
#
#  The goal of this test is to synchronize threat that handles
#  new X Client and thread that handles GR notifications to
# occure in the same moment.

-->echo #
-->echo # 1. Simulate Group-Replication notification (D1), and hang it
-->echo #    before processing clients
-->echo # 2. Make a new X Connection (X2), and hang in after accepting.
-->echo #    This prevents the session from being created. Synchronization
-->echo #    points are going to execute thread in order causin crash
-->echo # 3. Unblock X2, and validate that its possible to authenticate.
