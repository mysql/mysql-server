# Basic test for innodb_buffer_pool_load_now
#


# Restart mysqld to ensure that the status variables below do not contain
# stale value from previous executions of this or other tests. The following
# race could happen without this restart:
# 0. innodb_buffer_pool_load_status is 'Buffer pool(s) load completed ...'
# 1. SET innodb_buffer_pool_load_now = ON
# (1. does not start executing yet)
# 2. Wait for innodb_buffer_pool_load_status to become '... completed ...',
#    the condition is satisfied immediately
# (1. starts executing now)
# 3. Query innodb_buffer_pool_load_status, expecting 'completed', but it
#    contains something like 'Loading page 100/150'


# Check the default value
SET @orig = @@global.innodb_buffer_pool_load_now;
SELECT @orig;

# Do the dump
SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_dump_now = ON;

# Wait for the dump to complete
let $wait_condition =
  SELECT SUBSTR(variable_value, 1, 33) = 'Buffer pool(s) dump completed at '
  FROM performance_schema.global_status
  WHERE LOWER(variable_name) = 'innodb_buffer_pool_dump_status';
