# WL#5569/7165 MTS
#
# The test verifies MTS recovery in cases SQL applier threads (workers)
# have not completed all of their assignments at time they've been stopped.
# The state of the slave server might become insonsistent with that of the master
# 'cos there could be a number of event groups (transactions) uncommitted (gaps) followed
# with that of committed.
# The test proves that once the stop condition (e.g slave local error) is removed
# replication restarts, the gaps are filled up, and the eventual slave server state
# is consistent.
# The test is MTS Logical_clock specific due to a mechanism of failure injection.
