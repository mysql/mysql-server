# Bug#19855907 IO THREAD AUTHENTICATION ISSUE WITH SOME CHARACTER SETS
# Problem: IO thread fails to connect to master if servers are configured with
#  special character sets like utf16, utf32, ucs2.
#
# Analysis: MySQL server does not support few special character sets like
#  utf16,utf32 and ucs2 as "client's character set"(eg: utf16,utf32, ucs2).
#  When IO thread is trying to connect to Master, it sets server's character
#  set as client's character set. When Slave server is started with these
#  special character sets, IO thread (a connection to Master) fails because
#  of the above said reason.
#
# Fix: If server's character set is not supported as client's character set,
#  then set default's client character set(latin1) as client's character set.
