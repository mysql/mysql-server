# Bug#76727: SLAVE ASSERTION IN UNPACK_ROW WITH ROLLBACK TO
# SAVEPOINT IN ERROR HANDLER
#
# Problem:
# ========
# "SAVEPOINT", "ROLLBACK TO savepoint" wipe out table map on slave during
# execution binary log events. For trigger the map is written to binary log
# once
# for all trigger body and if trigger contains "SAVEPOINT" or
# "ROLLBACK TO savepoint" statements any trigger's events after these
# statements will not have table map. This results in an assert on slave.
