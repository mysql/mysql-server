# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verifies that replica-preserve-commit-order works for DDL transactions
# even when applier worker threads are not logging the changes to the
# replicas binary log.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. We start replica (server2) with the binary log turned off (--log-bin=OFF)
#    and applier threads are not logging to its own binary log
#    (--log-replica-updates=OFF). Replica also has replica_preserve_commit_order
#    enabled and running with 2 applier workers.
#
# 2. On slave, we lock table and then apply DDL statements on master in step 3.
#    We do this so that DDL query gets blocked when applier thread applies it
#    on slave.
#
# 3. The master generates some transactions which can be applied in parallel,
#    by setting same commit parents for all the inserts.
#
# 4. On slave, we verify that all the other inserts are also blocked and waiting
#    for first DDL statement to commit i.e. applier threads are in stage 'Waiting for
#    preceding transaction to commit' and their is no data in table except first
#    insert.
#
# 5. On slave, we unlock table, locked in step 2, and verify the
#    transactions applied in step 3 are applied successfully.
#
# 6. Cleanup.
