# Bug #21816399 5.6.24: LOST DATA DURING MASTER RESTART IF PARTIAL TRANSACT HAS
# BEEN DOWNLOADED
#
# Problem: If dump thread is killed (during shutdown/explicit kill) during
#  dumping a non-active binary log, events in the binary log are not getting
#  replicated.
# Steps to reproduce:
#  1) Create a binary log with some events
#  2) Rotate it to make it non-active log
#  3) While dump thread is sending data to slave, kill it.
#  4) Make sure that dump thread is killed
#  5) Start dump thread
#  6) See that there is no issue in replication
