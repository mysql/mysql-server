# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Check that the execution of SHOW SLAVE STATUS command is not blocked when IO
# thread is blocked writing an event to the relay log.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Simulate a scenario where IO thread is waiting while writing into the relay
# log, holding LOCK_log. Execute SHOW SLAVE STATUS command after IO thread is
# blocked writing an event. The command should not be blocked.
