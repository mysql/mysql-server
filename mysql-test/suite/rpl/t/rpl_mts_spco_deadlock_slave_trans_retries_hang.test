# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test verifies that deadlock errors arising due to lock conflicts are
# handled properly when --replica-preserve-commit-order is enabled on the replica
# server.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Create source-replica topolgy.
#
# 2. Setup testing environment.
#
#    2.1. Create table on source and insert few rows.
#    2.2. Setup necessary variables on replica server.
#
# 3. Execute transactions on source server that would generate deadlock on the
#    replica server.
#
#    The commands used to generate deadlock in this test are:
#
#    INSERT INTO t1 (11, NULL);
#    DELETE FROM t1 WHERE c2 <= 3;
#
#    With the help of debug points on the source server, simulate that they are
#    executed parallely on master and make sure INSERT is binlogged before
#    DELETE.
#
#    On replica server, they are applied parallel by w1 and w2. And the deadlock is:
#      w1                                        w2
#    -------------------------                 --------------------------
#     Applying INSERT                          Applying DELETE
#                                              Gets the row locks first.
#     Waits for w2 to release
#     the row lock.
#                                              Waits for w1 to commit.
#
#     For these two special statements, INSERT doesn't block DELETE, but DELETE
#     does block the INSERT because of the gap locks.
#
#    CASE 1:
#    3.1. Verify that replica server can find the deadlock when the victim
#         thread (DELETE) is waiting for its turn to commit and is handled
#         properly.
#    3.2. Wait till server to handle the deadlock and till the co-ordinator
#         thread to error out with ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK.
#    3.3. Restart the replication threads, sync the replica and verify that
#         table data is consistent.
#
#    CASE 2:
#    3.4. Verify that replica server can find the deadlock when the victim
#         thread (DELETE) is in the middle of transaction and is handled
#         properly.
#    3.5. Wait till server to handle the deadlock and till the co-ordinator
#         thread to error out with ER_MTA_INCONSISTENT_DATA.
#    3.6. Restart the replication threads, sync the replica and verify that
#         table data is consistent.
#
# 4. Cleanup.
