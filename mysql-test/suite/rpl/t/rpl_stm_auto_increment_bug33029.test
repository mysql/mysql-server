# BUG#33029 5.0 to 5.1 replication fails on dup key when inserting
# using a trig in SP

# For all 5.0 up to 5.0.58 exclusive, and 5.1 up to 5.1.12 exclusive,
# if one statement in a SP generated AUTO_INCREMENT value by the top
# statement, all statements after it would be considered generated
# AUTO_INCREMENT value by the top statement, and a erroneous INSERT_ID
# value might be associated with these statement, which could cause
# duplicate entry error and stop the slave.
