#
# Testing of Seconds_Behind_Master (SBM) to behave as the following
# SBM changes discretely per some number of processed group of events,
# e.g transactions.
# The number is either @@global.slave_checkpoint_group or less if
# @@global.slave_checkpoint_period timer elapses first.
# The value updates *after* the last group commit is executed.
# Resetting to zero behavior when Slave goes to read events is
# preserved.

# Idea of demonstration.
# 
# Two transactions on the same db are generated for MTS. The first has some
# natural delay, and the 2nd will be locked out of its data.
# While the first is being processed Coordinator empties the relay-log
# to enter waiting for more events.
# It does so being awakened @@global.slave_checkpoint_period-ically 
# to check out if some groups of events have been done to update SBM (demo 1). 
#
# Resetting of SBM is a possibility whenever Coordinator
# notices no more groups left neither to read nor to process (demo 2).
