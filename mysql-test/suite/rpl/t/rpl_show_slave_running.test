# Bug #30703  SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Slave_running' is not compatible with `SHOW SLAVE STATUS'
# The test verifies that  SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Slave_running' displays ON
# if and only if `SHOW SLAVE STATUS' displays YES for Slave_IO_Running and  Slave_SQL_Running

# Notice a difference between versions in showing p.2: 
# 5.1 has two OFF,ON IO-thread state running state whereas later versions
# have three: OFF,Connecting,ON.
# Hence, 5.1 must display OFF NO NO where as 5.1+ OFF Connecting NO
