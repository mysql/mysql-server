# Bug#11747416 : 32228 	A disk full makes binary log corrupt.
#
# 
# The test demonstrates reading from binlog error propagation to slave 
# and reporting there.
# Conditions for the bug include a crash at time of the last event to
# the binlog was written partly. With the fixes the event is not sent out 
# any longer, but rather the dump thread sends out a sound error message.
# 
# Crash is not simulated. A binlog with partly written event in its end is installed
# and replication is started from it.

# Otherwise we get occasional failures as the slave manages to re-connect
# to the newly started master and we get extra events applied, causing
# conflicts.
