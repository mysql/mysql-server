# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This script aims at testing that `LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP` doesn't acquire
# the BACKUP lock while the server is stopping the slave SQL thread - either by
# means of `STOP SLAVE` or `STOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD`.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# TC1. Lock instance for backup while `STOP SLAVE` executes
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# 1) Open two different connections, A and B to the slave node and set
#    `stop_slave_dont_release_backup_lock` debug sync point in both.
# 2) Through connection A, send a `STOP SLAVE` statement to the server that,
#    after acquiring the BACKUP lock, will wait for a
#    `tried_to_lock_instance_for_backup` signal in the
#    `stop_slave_dont_release_backup_lock` sync point.
# 3) Through connection B, execute a `LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP` statement and
#    expect a `ER_LOCK_WAIT_TIMEOUT` error.
# 4) Through connection B, send the `tried_to_lock_instance_for_backup` signal.
# 5) Through connection A, reap the result of the sent statement.
# 6) Check that the slave stopped and re-start it.
#
# TC2. Lock instance for backup while `STOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD` executes
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1) Open two different connections, A and B to the slave node and set
#    `stop_slave_dont_release_backup_lock` debug sync point in both.
# 2) Through connection A, send a `STOP SLAVE SQL_THREAD` statement to the
#    server that, after acquiring the BACKUP lock, will wait for a
#    `tried_to_lock_instance_for_backup` signal in the
#    `stop_slave_dont_release_backup_lock` sync point.
# 3) Through connection B, execute a `LOCK INSTANCE FOR BACKUP` statement and
#    expect a `ER_LOCK_WAIT_TIMEOUT` error.
# 4) Through connection B, send the `tried_to_lock_instance_for_backup` signal.
# 5) Through connection A, reap the result of the sent statement.
# 6) Check that the slave stopped and re-start it.
