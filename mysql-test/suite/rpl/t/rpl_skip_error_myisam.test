# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that --replica-skip-errors works correctly.  The error messages
# specified by --replica-skip-errors on slave should be ignored.  If
# such errors occur, they should not be reported and not cause the
# slave to stop.
#
# ==== Method ====
#
# We run the slave with --replica-skip-errors=1062 (the code for
# duplicate key).  Then we have two set of tests. In the first 
# set, we insert value 1 in a table on the slave, and then, on 
# master, we insert value 1 in the table. In the second set, we 
# insert several values on the master, disable the binlog and
# delete one of the values and re-enable the binlog. Right after,
# we perform an update on the set of values in order to generate
# a duplicate key on the slave. The errors should be ignored on
# the slave.

--echo ==== Using MyIsam ====

INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(3, 1);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(5, 1);

SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0;

SET SQL_LOG_BIN=1;
UPDATE t2 SET id= id + 3, data = 2;
