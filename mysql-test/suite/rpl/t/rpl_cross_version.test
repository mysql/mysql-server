# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify cross-version replication from an old master to the up-to-date slave
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Feed to the slave server a binlog recorded on an old version master 
# via setting up slave-to-slave replication. The latter is done by means of
# the opt file and include/setup_fake_relay_log.inc.
# The master's binlog is treated as a relay log that the SQL thread executes.
