# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify cross-version replication from an old master to the up-to-date slave
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Feed to the slave server a binlog recorded on an old version master 
# via setting up slave-to-slave replication. The latter is done by means of
# the opt file and include/setup_fake_relay_log.inc.
# The master's binlog is treated as a relay log that the SQL thread executes.
#

--source include/master-slave.inc

#
# Bug#31240 load data infile replication between (4.0 or 4.1) and 5.1 fails
#

--echo ==== Initialize ====
--connection slave

--disable_query_log
# The binlog contains the function RAND which is unsafe.
CALL mtr.add_suppression("Unsafe statement written to the binary log using statement format since BINLOG_FORMAT = STATEMENT");

--echo ==== Test ====
start slave sql_thread;
--let $slave_param = Exec_Master_Log_Pos
# end_log_pos of the last event of the relay log
--let $slave_param_value = 149436
--source include/wait_for_slave_param.inc
--echo ==== a prove that the fake has been processed successfully ====
