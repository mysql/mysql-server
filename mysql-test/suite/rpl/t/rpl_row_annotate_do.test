# WL47: Store in binlog text of statements that caused RBR events
# Wrapper for extra/rpl/rpl_row_annotate.test.
# Intended to test that if the --replicate-annotate-rows-events option
# is switched on on slave then Annotate_events:
# - are reproduced on slave
# - are reproduced only once for "multi-table-maps" rbr queries
# - are not reproduced when the corresponding queries are filtered away
#   on replication
# - are reproduced when the corresponding queries are filtered away partialy
#   (e.g. in case of multi-delete)
# - are not generated on slave for queries that are not annotated on master.
