# MDEV-359: There was a server crash when the code first checks if semisync
# is enabled without lock, then if so takes the lock and tests again.
# If semisync was disabled in-between the first and the second test, an
# assert was incorrectly made that referenced a NULL pointer.
#
# This tests uses debug_sync to pause one thread at the critical point in
# the code, disable the semisync, and then continue the paused thread.
