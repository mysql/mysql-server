# The test manually replaces the relay-log.info file with connection
# information which the slave then should pick up. However, to avoid
# overwriting the file, no CHANGE MASTER TO nor RESET SLAVE statements
# should be executed.
#
# Starting replication before granting a replication user privileges
# to replicate will cause the start slave to fail, so we shouldn't do
#  that.
