# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Bug #20644100  "Event crc check failed" when master disable binlog_checksum
#
# Starting slave sql_thread to apply events will cause event crc check
# failure when master disables binlog_checksum.
#
# Currently relay logs have the following sequence (starting from
# position 4):
# Format_desc (of slave)
# Previous-GTIDs (of slave, if GTIDs are enabled)
# Rotate (of master)
# Format_desc (of master)
# The Format_desc which really describes the rest of the relay
# log is the 4rd event, which is from master.
# Relay_log_info::init_relay_log_pos(...) will look for a
# Format_description_log_event from master. We only need this when
# slave applier thread starts and opens an existing relay log and
# has to execute it (possibly from an offset >4), because we need
# to read the description event of the relay log to be able to
# parse the events we have to execute.
# But the current code supposed that relay logs have the following
# sequence (starting from position 4):
# Format_desc (of slave)
# Rotate (of master)
# Format_desc (of master)
# So the function failed to find the Format_description_log_event
# from master when slave applier thread starts and opens an existing
# relay log and has to execute it, which causes some failures.
# The event crc check failure is one of them.
#
# Fix code to let slave applier thread also skip the Previous-GTIDs
# log event to find the correct Format_description_log_event from
# master when it is starting and opening an existing relay log.
#
# Steps to reproduce:
# 1) Start master and slave servers
# 2) Stop slave applier thread.
# 3) Write an event into binary log on master
#    when master disables binlog_checksum.
# 4) Start slave applier thread to verify that
#    their is no event crc check failure.
