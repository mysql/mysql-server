# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test verifies that executing START SLAVE command after restart of an
# initialized slave shall return no error.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Initialize the slave by sourcing master-slave.inc without starting the
#    slave threads.
#
# 2. Verify that START SLAVE doesn't throw any error when
#
#    2.1 Server is shutdown and restarted with --relay-log-recovery=1 so that
#        STOP EVENT is generated in the relay log.
#
#    2.2 Server is killed and restarted with --relay-log-recovery=1 and when no
#        STOP EVENTS is generated in the relay log.
#
# 3. Verify that a warning saying that "Server was not able to find a rotate
#    event from a master server to initialize relay log recovery" is logged in
#    the error log.
