# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify if the MTS SQL thread will became unresponsive after the slave
# applied a partial transaction (without the XID event) followed by a
# ROTATE event caused by IO thread reconnection when GTIDs and auto
# positioning are enabled.
#

# BUG#18885916 RELAY LOG WITHOUT XID_LOG_EVENT MAY CASE PARALLEL
#              REPLICATION HANG
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# This test uses debug points on the slave to make the
# IO thread to stop right after queuing a WRITE_ROWS log event.
#
# By doing this, the relay log file with the partial transaction
# will contain: [GTID,] QUERY(BEGIN), TABLE_MAP and WRITE_ROWS, but
# won't have the XID for the transaction.
#
# After reconnecting to the master, if the slave is configured with
# GTID and auto positioning, the IO thread will request the whole
# transaction again.
#
# The test case will then sync the slave with the master and verify
# that all data was correctly applied on slave.
