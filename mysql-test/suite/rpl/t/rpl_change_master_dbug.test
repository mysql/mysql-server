# The test also verifies that the 'Last_IO_Error' entry of SHOW SLAVE STATUS
# will display the number of real retries

## Checks that the slave actually gives up after retrying N times, where
## N was set with CHANGE MASTER TO master_retry_count=N

# the error message. Given that we force the slave to always report
# the error with the err_count exported in the retries field, we should

# when it stops.
