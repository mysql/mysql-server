#
# Whenever the mysql_binlog_send method (dump thread) reaches the
# end of file when reading events from the binlog, before checking
# if it should wait for more events, there was a test to check if
# the file being read was still active, i.e, it was the last known
# binlog. However, it was possible that something was written to
# the binary log and then a rotation would happen, after EOF was
# detected and before the check for active was performed. In this
# case, the end of the binary log would not be read by the dump
# thread, and this would cause the slave to lose updates.
#
# This test verifies that the problem has been fixed. It waits
# during this window while forcing a rotation in the binlog.
