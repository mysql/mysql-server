# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that performance_schema.threads shows the correct
# PROCESSLIST_INFO for all thread stages.
#
# This is to verify that BUG#21127308 has been fixed.  In the bug, the
# status of a replication worker thread waiting for more work (and
# several others) was not included in the array all_server_stages[],
# which caused PROCESSLIST_INFO in performance_schema.threads to be
# NULL for such threads.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# It's hard to simulate all possible thread stages, as each case needs
# to be simulated in its own ad-hoc way, likely using debug sync
# points.
#
# Instead, we verify the bug just for one of the stages that was
# missing in the bug.  Then, we parse mysqld.cc to find if there are
# any stages declared which are not listed in the array.
#
# This works currently, but the parsing depends on the current
# formatting in mysqld.  So this test will fail if e.g. the
# declarations are moved to another file, or the datatype
# PSI_stage_info is renamed, etc.  If that happens, please update this
# script accordingly.
