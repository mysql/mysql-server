# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Check that when the exectuion of a DROP TABLE command with single table
# fails it should not be written to the binary log. Also test that when the
# execution of DROP TABLE command with multiple tables fails then the fact
# if it will be logged or not depends on if any non-InnoDB tables are
# involved (as failed InnoDB-only multi-table DROP TABLE will have no
# effect).
#
# The above also provides coverage for changes to binary logging of failed
# DROP TABLES implemented as part of WL#7743 "New data dictionary: changes
# to DDL-related parts of SE API".
#
# ==== Implementation ====
# Create a database `db1` on master and ignore this database on the slave side
# using --replicate-ignore-db=db1 --replicate-wild-ignore-table=db1.%. Now
# execute a DROP TABLE command with single table in it and the command should
# fail thanks to error injection. Check in the binlog that query should
# not be binlogged. Slave should also be up and running without any errors.
# Execute another DROP TABLE command with multiple InnoDB tables in the drop
# list which will also fail. Check that the query is not binlogged in this
# case (as the whole statement is rolled back). Finally, execute multi-table
# DROP TABLE command involving MyISAM table which fails after deleting it.
# Check that query gets written into the binary log and slave should not fail
# since query is filtered on it.
#

# Bug#21435502: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MAY BRAKE REPLICATION IF SLAVE HAS
# REPLICATION FILTERS.
