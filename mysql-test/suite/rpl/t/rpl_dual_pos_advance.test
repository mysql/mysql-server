# This test checks that in a dual-head setup
# A->B->A, where A has --log-slave-updates (why would it?
# assume that there is a C as slave of A),
# then the Exec_master_log_pos of SHOW SLAVE STATUS does
# not stay too low on B(BUG#13023 due to events ignored because
# of their server id).
# It also will test BUG#13861.
