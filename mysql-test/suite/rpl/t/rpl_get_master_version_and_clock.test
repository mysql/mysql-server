# BUG#45214 
# This test verifies if the slave I/O tread tries to reconnect to
# master when it tries to get the values of the UNIX_TIMESTAMP, SERVER_ID,
# COLLATION_SERVER and TIME_ZONE from master under network disconnection.
# The COLLATION_SERVER and TIME_ZONE are got only on master server version 4.
# So they can't be verified by test case here.
# Finish the following tests by calling its common test script:  
# extra/rpl_tests/rpl_get_master_version_and_clock.test.

# The test is not supposed to have any binglog affairs.
# Hence it's enough it to run only with one binlog format
