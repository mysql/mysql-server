# BUG#45214 
# This test verifies if the slave I/O tread tries to reconnect to
# master when it tries to get the values of the UNIX_TIMESTAMP, SERVER_ID,
# COLLATION_SERVER and TIME_ZONE from master under network disconnection.
# The COLLATION_SERVER and TIME_ZONE are got only on master server version 4.
# So they can't be verified by test case here.
# Finish the following tests by calling its common test script:  
# extra/rpl_tests/rpl_get_master_version_and_clock.test. 
# And meanwhile this test checks that the slave I/O thread refuses to start if slave
# and master have the same server id (because this is a useless setup,
# and otherwise SHOW SLAVE STATUS shows progress but all queries are
# ignored, which has caught our customers), unless
# --replicate-same-server-id.
