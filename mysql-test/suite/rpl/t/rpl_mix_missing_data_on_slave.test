# Bug#21630907: MISSING DATA DETECTED WHEN MAX_BINLOG_SIZE SMALLER ON SLAVE
# FOR 3 NODE TOPOLOGY
#
# Bug#21053163: MIXED BASED REPLICATION LOOSES EVENTS WHEN
# RELAY_LOG_INFO_REPOSITORY=TABLE
#
# Problem:
# =======
# 2 level replication M1 -> S1 ->S2 ( S1 is slave of M1; S2 is slave of S1)
# replicating a non-transactional storage engine table (e.g. MyISAM) when set
# relay_log_info_repository=TABLE; and binlog rotation occurs in the middle
# of statement that was translated to multiple rows, then you loose part of
# that events.
#
# When binlog rotation occurs, on S1 not all rows are written to it's binlog,
# therefore S2 seamlessly looses part of rows that were translated from one
# statement to several rows.
#
# Test:
# =====
# Have mixed based replication, relay_log_info_repository=TABLE and
# max_binlog_size=4096 on all servers in 3 NODE TOPOLOGY. On master
# generate a single WRITE_ROWS_EVENT which has multiple row updates. When
# this event is replicated to slave, it will be split across relay logs.
# Test will verify that the data on all servers is the same.
# In the case of bug if
# 1) GTID_MODE is set to ON on all three servers, the slave will fail with
# error code:1837 i.e ER_GTID_NEXT_TYPE_UNDEFINED_GTID.
# 2) GTID_MODE is set to OFF on all three servers diff tables command will
# fail.
