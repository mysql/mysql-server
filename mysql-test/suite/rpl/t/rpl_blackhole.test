# PURPOSE. Test that blackhole works with replication in all three
# modes: STATEMENT, MIXED, and ROW.
#
# METHOD. We start by creating a table on the master and then change
# the engine to use blackhole on the slave.
#
# After insert/update/delete of one or more rows, the test the
# proceeds to check that replication is running after replicating an
# change, that the blackhole engine does not contain anything (which
# is just a check that the correct engine is used), and that something
# is written to the binary log.
#
# Whe check INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statement for tables with no
# key (forcing a range search on the slave), primary keys (using a
# primary key lookup), and index/key with multiple matches (forcing an
# index search).

# 
# The MASTER has MyISAM as the engine for both tables. The SLAVE has Blackhole
# on t1 (transactional engine) and MyISAM on t2 (non-transactional engine). 
#
# In MIXED mode, the command "INSERT INTO t2 SELECT * FROM t1" is logged as
# statement on the master. On the slave, it is tagged as unsafe because the
# statement mixes both transactional and non-transactional engines and as such
# its changes are logged as rows. However, due to the nature of the blackhole
# engine, no rows are returned and thus any chain replication would make the
# next master on the chain diverge.
#
# Fo this reason, we have disabled the statement.
