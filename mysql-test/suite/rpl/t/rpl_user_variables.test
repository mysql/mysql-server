# enough time to catch it before STOP SLAVE,

# test the slave immediately writes DROP TEMPORARY TABLE this_old_table).

# BUG#20141
# The following tests ensure that if user-defined variables are used in SF/Triggers 
# that they are replicated correctly. These tests should be run in both SBR and RBR 
# modes.

# This test uses a procedure that inserts data values based on the value of a 
# user-defined variable. It also has a trigger that inserts data based on the 
# same variable. Successful test runs show that the @var is replicated 
# properly and that the procedure and trigger insert the correct data on the 
# slave.
#
# The test of stored procedure was included for completeness. Replication of stored 
# procedures was not directly affected by BUG#20141.
