# It is not possible to replicate FOUND_ROWS() using statement-based
# replication, but there is a workaround that stores the result of
# FOUND_ROWS() into a user variable and then replicates this instead.
#
# The purpose of this test case is to test that the workaround works
# properly even when inside stored programs (i.e., stored routines and
# triggers).
