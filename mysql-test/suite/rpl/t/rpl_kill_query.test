# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test the behavior of slave when binlog_format=statement and a query
# that updates a non-transactional table is killed on the master,
# after being only half-way completed.
#
# The following should hold:
# - The statement should be logged with error code ER_QUERY_INTERRUPTED.
# - The slave should normally stop with an error.
# - If the table or database is filtered out, the slave should not stop.
#
# To test this, we test three cases:
#  1. Killed query on master generates error on slave.
#  2. Killed query on master, on a filtered-out table, does not
#     generate error on slave.
#  3. Killed query on master, on a table in a filtered-out database,
#     does not generate error on slave.
#
# ==== Implemenation ====
#
# For case 1, we extecute a statement and kill it in the middle, then
# verify that the slave stops with the correct error.
#
# For cases 2 and 3, we execute a statement and kill it in the middle,
# then verify that the slave replicates without problems.  In case 2,
# the statement is executed when the current database is filtered-out.
# In case 3, the statement modifies a table that is filtered-out.
#
# Slave filters are specified in rpl_kill_query.cnf
#
# The procedure to generate a killed statement is similar in all three
# cases.  See extra/rpl_tests/rpl_kill_query.inc for details.
