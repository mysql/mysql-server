# Testing that execution of two concurrent INSERTing connections both
# triggering the binlog rotation is correct even though their execution
# is interleaved.
# The test makes the first connection to complete the rotation part
# and yields control to the second connection that rotates as well and 
# gets first on purging. And the fact of interleaving does not create
# any issue.
