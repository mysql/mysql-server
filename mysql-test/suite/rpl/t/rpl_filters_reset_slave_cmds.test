# ==== Purpose ====
# Verify that global replication filters are not reset by RESET REPLICA [ALL]
# commands.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
# 1. Setup filters on the Slave.
# 2. Create a channel and verify filters on P_S tables.
# 3. Execute 'RESET REPLICA'. Verify filters on P_S tables. Expect no impact.
# 4. Execute 'RESET REPLICA ALL FOR CHANNEL..'. Verify filters on P_S tables.
#    Expect channel and per channel filters are removed. But, global filters
#    will remain the same.
# 5. Execute 'RESET REPLICA ALL'. Verify filters on P_S tables. Expect default
#    channel and per channel filters are removed. But, global filters
#    will remain the same.
# 6. Execute CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER..(). Verify global filters are reset.
