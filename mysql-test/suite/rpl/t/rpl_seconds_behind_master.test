# BUG#52166 test case 
#
# What to test?
#
# We want to test that Seconds_Behind_Master does not spike when SQL
# thread awakes to process a newly arrived event (queued by IO
# thread). Additionally, we want to assert that while SQL thread is
# waiting Seconds_Behind_Master will show zero.
#
# How to test?
#
#  1. Check that seconds behind master is set to 0 when SQL thread
#     waits for more events. We do this by first waiting for process
#     list to show SQL thread is indeed waiting and then inspect
#     Seconds_Behind_Master value.
#
#  2. Check that seconds behind master is updated once after a newly
#     received event starts to be processed. We do this by putting SQL
#     thread on hold by locking explicitly table t1. We then wait for
#     process list to show that SQL thread started processing the
#     desired query. At that time we inspect the Seconds_Behind_Master
#     and assert that it is in the desired time window.
