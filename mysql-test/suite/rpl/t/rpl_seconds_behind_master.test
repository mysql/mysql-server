# BUG#29309 test case

# We want to check that issuing FLUSH LOGS on the slave does not cause
# transient, incorrect calculation of Seconds_Behind_Source while SQL
# thread is executing an event.
#
# How to test?
#
# 1. let slave start 3 seconds after an insert on table t1 is issued
#    on the master 
# 2. while locking t1 for write (SQL thread is on-hold) assert that
#    slave is 3 seconds behind the master
# 3. sleep 3 more seconds
# 4. repeat step #2, but before checking Seconds_Behind_Source, issue
#    a FLUSH LOGS.
# 5. assert that Seconds_Behind_Source is within the expected time window

# BUG#52166 test case 
#
# What to test?
#
# We want to test that Seconds_Behind_Source does not spike when SQL
# thread awakes to process a newly arrived event (queued by IO
# thread). Additionally, we want to assert that while SQL thread is
# waiting Seconds_Behind_Source will show zero.
#
# How to test?
#
#  1. Check that seconds behind master is set to 0 when SQL thread
#     waits for more events. We do this by first waiting for process
#     list to show SQL thread is indeed waiting and then inspect
#     Seconds_Behind_Source value.
#
#  2. Check that seconds behind master is updated once after a newly
#     received event starts to be processed. We do this by putting SQL
#     thread on hold by locking explicitly table t1. We then wait for
#     process list to show that SQL thread started processing the
#     desired query. At that time we inspect the Seconds_Behind_Source
#     and assert that it is in the desired time window.
