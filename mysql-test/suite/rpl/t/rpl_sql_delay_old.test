#
# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test checks if the sql delay is being applied in a simple master-slave
# topology.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# The SQL_Delay is set to 5 seconds.
# For each for the six different transactions executed (two DDL, three DML and
# one multi-statement DML), the test verifies if the delay was the expected using
# replication timestamp infrastructure introduced by WL#7319.
