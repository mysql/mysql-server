#   BUG#28796: CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST="" leads to invalid master.info
#
# Description
# -----------
#
#   This test aims at: 
#     i) verifying that an error is thrown when setting MASTER_HOST=''
#     ii) no error is thrown when setting non empty MASTER_HOST
#     iii) replication works after setting a correct host name/ip
#
#   Implementation is performed by feeding different values (according
#   to i), ii) and iii) ) to CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST= x and checking
#   along the way if error/no error is thrown and/or if replication starts
#   working when expected.
