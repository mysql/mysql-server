# === Purpose ===
# Check PURGE BINARY LOGS operation is mutually exclusive with BACKUP lock.
#
# === Requirements ===
# R1. PURGE BINARY LOGS must be mutually exclusive with BACKUP operation.
#
# === Implementation ===
# 1. Lock replica for backup
# 2. Flush binary logs so relay log is tried to be pureged
# 3. Check that relay logs have not been purged
# 4. Unblock backup on replica
# 5. Generate log purge from source onto replica
# 6. Check relay logs have been purged on replica
#
# === References ===
# Bug#35342521	Binary log purge should hold IX backup lock
