# here.  So we should have a deadlock.  If it is not resolved
# automatically we'll detect it with master_pos_wait that waits for
# farther than 1Ob; it will timeout after 300 seconds (which is inline
# with the default used for sync_slave_with_master and will protect us
# against slow test envs); also the slave will probably not cooperate
# to shutdown (as 2 threads are locked)
