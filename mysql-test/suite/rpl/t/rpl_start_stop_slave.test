# Bug#38205 Row-based Replication (RBR) causes inconsistencies...
# Bug#319   if while a non-transactional slave is replicating a transaction...
#
# Verifying that STOP SLAVE does not interrupt excution of a group
# execution of events if the group can not roll back.
# Killing the sql thread continues to provide a "hard" stop (the
# part II, moved to the bugs suite as it's hard to make it
# deterministic with KILL).
#

#
# Part I. The being stopped sql thread finishes first the current group of 
#         events if the group contains an event on a non-transaction table.
