#BUG#11752315 : STOP SLAVE UNABLE TO COMPLETE WHEN SLAVE THREAD IS TRYING 
#               TO RECONNECT TO 
#
# ==== Purpose ====
#
#Tests that the slave does not go to a sleep for a long duration after the 
#master is killed and we do a START_SLAVE and STOP_SLAVE.
#
# ==== Method ====
#
#This is a new functionality of having an interruptable sleep of the slave.
#We find the thread id for the slave thread. On finding the thread ID of the 
#slave thread we kill the slave thread. A successful kill in less than 60 sec 
#should serve the purpose of checking the functionality.
