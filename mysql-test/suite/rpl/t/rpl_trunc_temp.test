# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that Slave_open_temp_tables is increased when a temporary
# table is opened on the slave, and decreased when a temporary table
# is closed on the slave, and that it is preserved during 'DELETE FROM
# table' and 'TRUNCATE table'.
#
# ==== Method ====
#
# Create a temporary table on master, insert rows, and try:
#  - delete rows from the table
#  - truncate the table
#  - drop the table
#
# ==== Related bugs ====
#
# BUG#17137 Running "truncate table" on temporary table leaves the table open on a slave

# Bug in this test: BUG#37493: rpl_trunc_temp.test nondeterministic


# Requires statement-based logging since temporary tables are not
# logged in row-based logging. Same now goes for mixed, valid for statement
# only replication as a result of 72475
