#
# === Purpose ===
# This test script verifies that in a replication environment,
# when we have different errors on master and slave side, and if
# we have ER_INCONSISTENT_ERROR specified in the replica_skip_errors
# list the replication should not stop with error ER_INCONSISTENT_ERROR.
#
# === Implementation ===
#1. Create a table using MyISAM storage engine.
#
#2. Insert a row with binary logging off, this is done to be able to
#   generate error in the next query while trying to store a duplicate
#   value in a column which accepts only unique value.
#
#3. As the bin logging was off for the first transaction the slave will only
#   apply the second insert statement (the one which caused error on master).
#   And should have thrown 'ER_INCONSISTENT_ERROR' error as the expected
#   error(ER_DUP_ENTRY) is different from the actual error(No error).
#
#4. Now as we have passed ER_INCONSISTENT_ERROR to --replica-skip-errors in the
#   .opt file the slave will not throw any error and the replication should
#   continue.
#
#5. Test if replication is working fine by taking diff of tables on master
#   and slave.
