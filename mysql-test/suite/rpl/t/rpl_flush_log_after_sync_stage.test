#
# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test verifies that when binlog rotation occurs before updating
# MYSQL_BIN_LOG::binlog_end_pos in SYNC stage of binlog group commit, receiver
# thread doesn't stop with an error. Receiver thread's execution should be
# fine.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Have sync_binlog= 1.
# 2. Hold master's binlog sender thread during sync stage of binlog group
#    commit just before updating the binary log end position.
# 3. Execute FLUSH LOGS in another session so that binary log gets rotated.
# 4. Allow the sync operation to proceed further in master connection.
# 5. Slave should be in sync with master. It should not error out.
