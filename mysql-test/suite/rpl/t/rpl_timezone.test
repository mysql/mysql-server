# There is currently some bug possibly in prepared statements (this
# test fails with --ps-protocol): sys_var_thd_time_zone::value_ptr()
# is called only at prepare time, not at execution time. So,
# thd->time_zone_used is not equal to 1 (it is back to 0, because of
# reset_thd_for_next_command called at execution time), so the
# timezone used in CONVERT_TZ is not binlogged. To debug (by Guilhem
# and possibly Konstantin).
