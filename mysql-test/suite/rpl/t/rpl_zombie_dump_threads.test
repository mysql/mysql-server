# Bug#21179199 ZOMBIE DUMP THREADS ARE NOT DISCONNECTED,
#              CAN ALSO LEAD TO A CRASH
#
#  Problem: Zombie dump threads on Master (>= MySQL-5.6 version)
#           that are created to server slaves which are on lower
#           versions than MySQL-5.6 version are not getting killed.
#  Steps to reproduce:
#
#  1) A simulation point on slave to fake that server MySQL version is lower
#     than MySQL-5.6 (i.e., no replica_uuid set in initial replication protocol)
#
#  2) Start IO thread on Slave which will start a dump thread on Master.
#
#  3) Restart the IO thread (Master should kill existing dump thread before
#     starting a new dump thread)
#
#  4) Now count the number of dump threads on Master, it should be only '1'.
