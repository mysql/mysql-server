# This line and the line below is a temporary line for tests that do not need MyISAM in future, but need to be kept for tests that need it.

# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test that nondeterministic system functions are correctly replicated.
#
# (Some functions are only correctly replicated if binlog_format=MIXED
# or ROW.  See binlog_unsafe.test for a test that those variables are
# indeed unsafe.)
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# We insert the values of each unsafe function into a table. Then we
# replicate and check that the table is identical on slave.
#
# ==== Related bugs ====
#
# BUG#47995
