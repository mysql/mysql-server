# ==== Purpose ====
#
# The purpose of this script is to test that replication plugins are
# properly unloaded when `replication_optimize_for_static_plugin_config` is
# enabled.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# R1. Upon server shutdown, all replication plugins should cleanly unload
#     even if `replication_optimize_for_static_plugin_config` is enabled.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Install a replication plugin.
# 2. Turn `replication_optimize_for_static_plugin_config` on.
# 3. Stop and start the server.
<<<<<<< HEAD
# 4. Check that no error message regarding erroneous plugin unloading has
#    been logged to the error log.
# 5. Clean up.
=======
# 4. Clean up.
# 5. Let MTR check-testcase infra-structure check that no error message
#    regarding erroneous plugin unloading has been logged to the error log.
