#
# The test checks cases of hashing conflicts forcing a special hanling.
# The cases include
#
# I. two Worker jobs conflict to each other
#
#   a. two multi-statement transactions containing more than one partition
#      in which one is common are mapped to different Workers.
#   b. similarly two autocommit queries or ddl:s
#
# Handling of the cases is carried out as the following:
# when Coordinator hits to an occupied by not the currenly assigned Worker
# partition it marks the partition and goes to wait till the Worker-owner
# has released it and signaled.
#
# II. An event requires the sequential execution
#
# Coordinator does not schedule the event and is waiting till all workers have 
# released their partitions and signalled.

--source include/master-slave.inc

# 
#  Testing with the statement format requires 
#  @@global.slave_run_query_in_parallel = 1.
#  Notice, parallelization for Query-log-event is limitted
#  to the default dababase. That's why 'use db'.
#  With the default @@global.slave_run_query_in_parallel == 0
#  the tests in stmt format still run to prove switching to the sequential.

#  TODO: convert this file into two tests for either value of
