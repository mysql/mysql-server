# ==== Purpose ====
#
# The test verifies the slave applier recovery after non-atomic DDL
# crashes the server.
# The test specifies slave_relay_log_info as of TABLE type.
# At post-crash the slave service must recover and the applier resumes
# from a correct binlog position.
# The subject is not trivial as it may look because even with the slave binlogging
# turned ON the post-crash recovering slave can't make use of its binlog as
# the non-atomic DDL is not xided.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Simulate the crash once a non-atomic DDL completes on the slave
# server including the final phase of the slave applier committing an
# update into the info table.
# At restart the slave server recovery must always find the slave info table updated
# so never attempt binlog-based recovery for it which otherwise would
# be in vain thanks to missed XID info.
#

# WL#9175  Correct recovery of DDL statements/transactions by binary log
#
# See other tests like rpl_atomic_ddl, rpl_half_atomic_ddl verifying
# the atomic DDL classes.
