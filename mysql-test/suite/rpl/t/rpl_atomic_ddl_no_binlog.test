# ==== Purpose ====
# The same as the sourced rpl_atomic_ddl:
# prove successful slave service recovery after simulated failures
# at handling recoverable DDL queries.
# This time the slave turns binlog off so its post-crash recovery...
#
# Find more comments in the sourced file.

--let $rollback_message=Crash right after the query has been committed
--let $crash_rollback="+d,slave_crash_before_commit"
