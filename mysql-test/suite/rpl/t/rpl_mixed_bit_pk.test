#  BUG#39753: Replication failure on MIXED + bit + myisam + no PK
#
# Description
# -----------
#  Simple statements against a bit column cause failure in mixed-mode
#  replication.
#
#  Implementation is as follows:
#     i) A table with two bit fields is created. One of them is a key.
#    ii) A record is inserted without specifying the key value.
#   iii) The record is deleted using a where clause that matches it.
#    iv) repeat i-iii) for bit key that has different size, generating
#        different extra bits values 
#     v) The slave is synchronized with master 
#    vi) The table is dropped on master and the slave is re-synchronized
#        with master.
#
#  Step v) made the bug evident before the patch, as the slave would 
#  fail to find the correspondent row in its database (although it did
#  the insert in step ii) ).
#
# Obs
# --- 
#  This test is based on the "how to repeat" section from the bug report.
