# Bug#18364070  BACKPORT BUG#18236612 TO MYSQL-5.6
# Problem & Analysis : When Slave SQL thread detects that Master was restarted
#  with the help of information sent by Master through 'FormatDescription'
#  event, slave SQL drops all the opened temporary tables in order to have
#  proper cleanup. While slave SQL thread is dropping the temporary tables, it
#  is not decrementing Replica_open_temp_tables count.
#  Fix: Decrement Replica_open_temp_tables count in this case.
# Steps to test:
#  1) Create a temporary table
#  2) Sync it with slave
#  3) Stop replica io thread
#  4) Kill Master which generates Format Description event
#  5) Restart Master again
#  6) Start replica io thread
#  7) Wait till SQL thread applies all events
#     (which includes newly generated Format Description event)
#  8) Now verify that Replica_open_temp_tables has '0' value

# This same test steps with gtid enabled mode, works to test the following
# bug as well.
# Bug#18069107 SLAVE CRASHES WITH GTIDS,TEMP TABLE, STOP IO_THREAD, START SLAVE
# Problem & Analysis : When Slave SQL thread detects that Master was restarted
#  with the help of information sent by Master through 'FormatDescription'
#  event, slave SQL drops all the opened temporary tables in order to have
#  proper cleanup. When Gtid mode is on and while slave SQL thread is
#  generating DROP TEMPORARY statement for all these temporary tables,
#  server is hitting an assert DEBUG_ASSERT(gtid.spec_type != UNDEF_GROUP)
