#  BUG#39701: Mixed binlog format does not switch to row mode on LOAD_FILE
#
#  DESCRIPTION
#
#    Problem: when using load_file string function and mixed binlogging format
#             there was no switch to row based binlogging format. This leads
#             to scenarios on which the slave replicates the statement and it
#             will try to load the file from local file system, which in most
#             likely it will not exist.
#
#    Solution:
#             Marking this function as unsafe for statement format, makes the
#             statement using it to be logged in row based format. As such, data 
#             replicated from the master, becomes the content of the loaded file.
#             Consequently, the slave receives the necessary data to complete
#             the load_file instruction correctly.
#
#  IMPLEMENTATION
#
#    The test is implemented as follows:
#
#      On Master,
#       i) write to file the desired content.
#      ii) create table and stored procedure with load_file
#     iii) stop replica
#     iii) execute load_file 
#      iv) remove file
#
#      On Slave,
#       v) start replica
#      vi) sync it with master so that it gets the updates from binlog (which 
#          should have bin logged in row format). 
#
#          If the the binlog format does not change to row, then the assertion
#          done in the following step fails. This happens because tables differ 
#          since the file does not exist anymore, meaning that when slave 
#          attempts to execute LOAD_FILE statement it inserts NULL on table 
#          instead of the same contents that the master loaded when it executed 
#          the procedure (which was executed when file existed).
#
#     vii) assert that the contents of master and slave 
#          table are the same
