# ==== Purpose ====
# The same as the sourced rpl_half_atomic_ddl:
# prove successful slave service recovery after a simulated failure
# at handling recoverable DDL queries.
# This time the slave turns binlog off so its post-crash recovery...
#
# Find more comments in the sourced file.

--let $commit_message=Crash right before the query gets committed
--let $crash_commit="+d,replica_crash_after_commit"

# There can't be rollback recovery, therefore it's not tested
#--let $crash_rollback="+d,no_binlog_replica_crash_before_commit"

--source rpl_half_atomic_ddl.test
