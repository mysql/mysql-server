# Bug#19949915  IGNORABLE EVENTS DO NOT WORK AND ARE NOT TESTED
#
# Problem:
#  In 5.6, Ignorable log events were introduced. These events have
#  the flag LOG_EVENT_IGNORABLE_F flag (0x80) set in the flags field.
#  When the server (specifically, the replication receiver and applier
#  threads) sees an event with a type code it does not recognize, the
#  server is supposed to check if this flag is set. If the flag is not
#  set, the server generates an error and stops; if the flag is set,
#  the server ignores the event. The purpose is to allow future server
#  versions to introduce new event types that the slave can ignore
#  (such as informational event types). However, this does not work,
#  since the slave applier thread explicitly checks if the type code
#  is in the range of known event types, and reports an error, before
#  it goes further and checks if the event is ignorable.
# Fix:
#  The slave applier thread does not check if this is a known event
#  type any more.
#
# Steps to reproduce:
#  1) Set a debug point on slave to simulate unknown ignorable log events.
#  2) Write a write_rows log event and a previous gtids log event
#     if gtid mode is on to binlog on master.
#  3) The slave receiver thread simulates an unknown ignorable
#     log event by rewriting the write rows log event and
#     previous gtids log event if gtid mode is on before
#     writing it(them) in relay log.
#  4) Verify that the slave applier thread skips the unknown ignorable
#     log event.
