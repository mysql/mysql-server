# BUG#19958: RBR idempotency issue for UPDATE and DELETE

# Statement-based and row-based replication have different behaviour
# when updating a row with an explicit WHERE-clause that matches
# exactly one row (or no row at all). For statement-based replication,
# the statement is idempotent since the first time it is executed, it
# will update exactly one row, and the second time it will not update
# any row at all.  This was not the case for row-based replication, so
# we test under both row-based and statement-based replication both
# for tables with and without primary keys.

# bug#31609 Not all RBR slave errors reported as errors
# bug#31552 Replication breaks when deleting rows from out-of-sync table
#           without PK

#
# Idempotent applying is not default any longer.
# The default for slave-exec-mode option and server
# variable slave_exec_mode  is 'STRICT'.
# When 'STRICT' mode is set, the slave SQL thread will stop whenever
# the row to change is not found. In 'IDEMPOTENT' mode, the SQL thread
# will continue running and apply the row - replace if it's Write_rows event -
# or skip to the next event.

# the previous part of the tests was with IDEMPOTENT slave's mode.
