# BUG#19958: RBR idempotency issue for UPDATE and DELETE

# Statement-based and row-based replication have different behaviour
# when updating a row with an explicit WHERE-clause that matches
# exactly one row (or no row at all). For statement-based replication,
# the statement is idempotent since the first time it is executed, it
# will update exactly one row, and the second time it will not update
# any row at all.  This was not the case for row-based replication, so
# we test under both row-based and statement-based replication both
# for tables with and without primary keys.
