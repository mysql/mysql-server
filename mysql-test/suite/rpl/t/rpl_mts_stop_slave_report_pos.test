# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that the positions that are reported by the applier thread during
# STOP SLAVE are the same as that of the most recent checkpoint in case of
# Multi Threaded Slave.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1) Create two databases and do some DML operations on these databases.
# 2) Sync the slave applier with master to insure that a checkpoint is done.
# 3) Set bigger values for replica_checkpoint_period/group so that no further
#    checkpoints are done on slave server.
# 4) Execute few more DMLS on master and wait till they are applied on slave.
# 5) This is to prove that applier thread has few more committed transactions
#    after the checkpoint done at step 2.
# 6) Execute STOP SLAVE command.
# 7) Assert that the positions that are reported in error log are as per the
#    latest checkpoint.
