# Test for BUG#1858 "OPTIMIZE TABLE done by a client
# thread stops the slave SQL thread".
# You can replace OPTIMIZE by REPAIR.
#####################################
# Change Author: JBM
# Change Date: 2006-02-09
# Change: NDB does not and will not support
# OPTIMIZE for memory tables. If and when 
# it does support for Disk Data, a new 
# version of this test will be need.
# Skipping this test if default engine = ndb

# Bug#18128323: On SLOW Solaris/WINT machines and debug
# builds test is failing due to timeout (if InnoDB engine).
# Hence, we will be using MyISAM engine as default until
# that issue is sorted out.
