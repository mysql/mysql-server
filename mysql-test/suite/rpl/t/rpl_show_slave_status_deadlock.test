# Bug#19843808: DEADLOCK ON FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK + SHOW
# SLAVE STATUS
#
# Problem:
# ========
# If a client thread on an slave does FLUSH TABLES WITH READ
# LOCK; then master does some updates, SHOW SLAVE STATUS in
# the same client will be blocked.
#
# Test:
# =====
# Execute a DML on master and make it blocked on slave after entering commit.
# Execute FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK on slave. Allow the blocked DML to
# continue. The sql thread will be blocked in a state where it has acquired
# rli->data_lock and it is waiting for MDL COMMIT lock. Now execute show slave
# status command from the same client where FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK was
# issued. The show slave status command should not be blocked.
