# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test script serves as the functionality testing for the table
# performance_schema.replication_applier_configuration. Test for ddl and dml
# operations is a part of the perfschema suite. The ddl/dml tests are named:
# 1) ddl_replication_applier_configuration.test and
# 2) dml_replication_applier_configuration.test.
#
# The follwing scenarios are tested in this script:
#
#  - Verify that output is same as SSS on a fresh slave.
#  - Verify that the value of this field is correct after STOP SLAVE.
#  - Verify that, when desired delay is set, the value is shown corectly.
#  - Verify that the value is preserved after STOP SLAVE.
#  - Verify that, when desired delay is reset, the value is shown corectly.
