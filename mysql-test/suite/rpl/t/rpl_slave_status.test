# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that a slave without replication privileges has
# Slave_IO_Running = No
#
# ==== Method ====
#
# We do the following steps:
# - Create a new replication user on master
# - Connect to slave and start replication as this user.
# - Verify that slave can replicate well, by creating a table and
#   inserting a row into it.
# - Delete the user from the master.
# - Stop and start the slave (this should fail).
# - Check the Slave_IO_Running column of SHOW SLAVE STATUS.
#

--echo ==== Create new replication user ====
--echo [on master]

--echo ==== Do replication as new user ====
--echo [on master]
connection master;
CREATE TABLE t1 (n INT);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1);
--echo [on slave]

SELECT * FROM t1;

--echo ==== Delete new replication user ====
--echo [on master]

--echo [on slave]

--echo ==== Restart slave without privileges =====
# (slave.err will contain access denied error for this START SLAVE command)

--echo ==== Verify that Slave_IO_Running = No ====

--echo ==== Cleanup (Note that slave IO thread is not running) ====
DROP TABLE t1;
# cleanup: slave io thread has been stopped "irrecoverably"
# so we clean up mess manually

--echo [on master]
