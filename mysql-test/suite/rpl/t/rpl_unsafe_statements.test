# Bug#17047208 REPLICATION DIFFERENCE FOR MULTIPLE TRIGGERS
# Problem: If DML invokes a trigger or a stored function that inserts into an
# AUTO_INCREMENT column, that DML has to be marked as 'unsafe' statement. If the
# tables are locked in the transaction prior to DML statement (using LOCK
# TABLES), then the DML statement is not marked as 'unsafe' statement.

# Steps to reproduce the reported test case (BINLOG_STMT_UNSAFE_AUTOINC_COLUMNS)
# Case-1:
#  > Create a trigger on a table and do a insert in the trigger that updates
#     auto increment column
#  > A DML that executes the trigger in step.1 and check that DML is marked
#     as unsafe and DML is written into binlog using row format (in MBR)
#  > Execute the step 2 by locking the required tables prior to DML and check
#     that DML is marked as unsafe and DML is written into binlog using row
#     format (in MBR)
#
#  This test script also adds test cases to cover few other unsafe statements.
#    Case-2: BINLOG_STMT_UNSAFE_WRITE_AUTOINC_SELECT
#    Case-3: BINLOG_STMT_UNSAFE_AUTOINC_NOT_FIRST
#    Case-4: BINLOG_STMT_UNSAFE_INSERT_TWO_KEYS

--source include/rpl/init_source_replica.inc

# Case-1: BINLOG_STMT_UNSAFE_AUTOINC_COLUMNS
#  Statement is unsafe because it invokes a trigger or a
#  stored function that inserts into an AUTO_INCREMENT column.

# Step-1.1: Create two tables, one with AUTO_INCREMENT column.
CREATE TABLE t1(id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, i INT, PRIMARY KEY (id)) ENGINE=INNODB;
CREATE TABLE t2(id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, i INT, PRIMARY KEY (id)) ENGINE=INNODB;

# Step-1.2: Create a trigger that inserts into an AUTO_INCREMENT column.
CREATE TRIGGER trig1 AFTER INSERT ON t1
FOR EACH ROW
  INSERT INTO t2(i) VALUES(new.i);

# Step-1.3: Create some gap in auto increment value on master's t2 table
# but not on slave (by doing rollback). Just in case if the unsafe statements
# are written in statement format, diff tables will fail.
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO t2(i) VALUES (1);
ROLLBACK;

# Step-1.4: Insert a tuple into table t1 that triggers trig1 which inserts
# into an AUTO_INCREMENT column.
INSERT INTO t1(i) VALUES(2);

# Step-1.5: Repeat step 1.4 but using 'LOCK TABLES' logic.
START TRANSACTION;
LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, t2 WRITE;
INSERT INTO t1(i) VALUES(3);
UNLOCK TABLES;
COMMIT;

# Step-1.6: Sync slave with master
--sync_slave_with_master

# Step-1.7: Diff source-replica tables to make sure everything is in sync.
--let $diff_tables=master:t1, slave:t1
--source include/diff_tables.inc

--let $diff_tables=master:t2, slave:t2
--source include/diff_tables.inc

# Step-1.8: Cleanup
--connection master
DROP TABLE t1,t2;

# Case-2: BINLOG_STMT_UNSAFE_WRITE_AUTOINC_SELECT
#  Statements writing to a table with an auto-increment column after selecting
#  from another table are unsafe because the order in which rows are retrieved
#  determines what (if any) rows will be written. This order cannot be
#  predicted and may differ on master and the slave.

# Step-2.1: Create two tables,  one with AUTO_INCREMENT column.
CREATE TABLE t1(i INT) ENGINE=INNODB;
CREATE TABLE t2(id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, i INT, PRIMARY KEY (id)) ENGINE=INNODB;

# Step-2.2: Create some tuples in table t1.
INSERT INTO t1 values (1), (2), (3);

# Step-2.3: Create some gap in auto increment value on master's t2 table
# but not on slave (by doing rollback). Just in case if the unsafe statements
# are written in statement format, diff tables will fail.
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO t2(i) VALUES (1);
ROLLBACK;

# Step-2.4: Insert into t2 (table with an auto-increment) by selecting tuples
# from table t1.
INSERT INTO t2(i) SELECT i FROM t1;

# Step-2.5: Repeat step 2.4 but now with 'LOCK TABLES' logic.
START TRANSACTION;
LOCK TABLES t2 WRITE, t1 READ;
INSERT INTO t2(i) SELECT i FROM t1;
UNLOCK TABLES;
COMMIT;

# Step-2.6: Sync slave with master

# Step-2.7: Diff source-replica tables to make sure everything is in sync.
--let $diff_tables=master:t1, slave:t1

--let $diff_tables=master:t2, slave:t2
--source include/diff_tables.inc

# Step-2.8: Cleanup
--connection master
DROP TABLE t1,t2;

# Case-4: BINLOG_STMT_UNSAFE_INSERT_TWO_KEYS
#  INSERT... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE  on a table with more than one UNIQUE KEY
#  is unsafe Statement

# Step-4.1: Create a table with two unique keys
CREATE TABLE t1(i INT, j INT, UNIQUE KEY(i), UNIQUE KEY(j)) ENGINE=INNODB;

# Step-4.2: Inserting into such a table is unsafe.
INSERT INTO t1 (i,j) VALUES (1,2) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE j=j+1;

# Step-4.3: Repeat step 3.2, now with 'LOCK TABLES' logic.
START TRANSACTION;
LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE;
INSERT INTO t1 (i,j) VALUES (1,2) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE j=j+1;
