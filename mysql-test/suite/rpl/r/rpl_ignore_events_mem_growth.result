# Step-2) Create a sample table to create ignored/skipped
#         insert events on the table. And run some sample
#         inserts on both nodes, so that initial hiccups
#         in bytes used will not be counted.

[connection server_1]
CREATE TABLE t1(i INT);
include/rpl/sync.inc
[connection server_1]
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (2);
[connection server_2]
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (3);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (4);

#
# Step-3) If gtid_mode is OFF, set sql_replica_skip_counter to 50 on
#         M2 node and restart sql thread to make the change effective.
#
#         If gtid_mode is ON, execute 50 empty transactions on
#         M2 node, so that 50 transactions from M1 will be skipped.

#
# Step-4) Record thd::main_mem_root usage values on both servers before
#         starting the experiment.
#
[connection server_1]
[connection server_2]
#
# Step-5) Insert 100 sample queries on M1 node. First 50 inserts will
#         be ignored on M2 node (because sql_replica_skip_counter set to
#         50). Second 50 inserts will be executed on M2 and will be
#         replicated back to M1 node. But they will be ignored on M1
#         because they were originated on M1 node.
#
[connection server_1]
include/rpl/sync.inc
[connection server_2]
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (100);
include/rpl/sync.inc
#
# Step-6) Record thd::main_mem_root usage value on M1 after
#         the experiment. Check that thd::main_mem_root value
#         did not increased.
#
[connection server_1]
include/assert.inc [thd::main_mem_root on M1 should be the same value as before experiment value.]
#
# Step-7) Record thd::main_mem_root usage value on M2 after
#         the experiment. Check that thd::main_mem_root value
#         did not increased.
#
[connection server_2]

# Step-8) Cleanup.
