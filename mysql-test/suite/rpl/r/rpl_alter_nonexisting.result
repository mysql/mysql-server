# Bug #22086705: ALTER NOT EXISTING DATABASE BREAKS REPLICATION
#
# Problem: Binlog is written before doing the change in the dd.
# Checking for existence is part of the dd update.
#
# Fix: Do the change in the dd before writing binlog. Non-existing
# databases will cause an early exit prior to writing binlog.

# Test written by Matthias Leich.
