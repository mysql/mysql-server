# Bug#47699 rpl.rpl_backup_block fails sporadically
#
# START SLAVE released the lock and returned before it cleared the error,
# so there is a possibility that Slave_SQL_Error is not 0.

Note	####	Sending passwords in plain text without SSL/TLS is extremely insecure.
Note	####	Storing MySQL user name or password information in the master info repository is not secure and is therefore not recommended. Please consider using the USER and PASSWORD connection options for START SLAVE; see the 'START SLAVE Syntax' in the MySQL Manual for more information.
