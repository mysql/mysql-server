# Verify:
#  Relay log file names are properly set for multisource replication
#  In this tests we test if relay log files per channel based
#  on --relay-log-index and --relay-log is properly set.
# 1. The slave is started with --relay-log=msr-relay
# 2. the slave is restarted with --relay-log-index=idx-msr-relay
# 3. the slave is restarted with --relay-log-index=idx-msr-relay.idx
#     and --relay-log=msr-relay.log
