# the plan for the following query should be a range scan.  about 1 of 10 times,
# the plan is an index scan.  the different scan type occurs because the query optimizer
# is handed different row counts by tokudb::records_in_range.  the cost estimates made
# by the query optimizer are very close to begin with.  sometimes, the cost of an index
# scan is less than the cost of a range scan.
#
# if a tokudb checkpoint occurs before this query is run, then the records_in_range
# function returns a larger than expected row estimate.
#
# column 4 is the join type (should be range or index)
# column 9 is the estimated key count
