#To test multi-tc take over in various manners we create one node with a TC that
#has only 1 TC but have more transactions that can be handled in one go by the
#takeover TC. The other node have both multiple TCs and also more operations than
#can be handled in one go. So it has to both handle each TC takeover instance in
#multiple steps and it has to handle multiple instances.
