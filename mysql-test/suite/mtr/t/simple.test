#
# This tests the following:
#   simple.test has two combinations (in simple.combinations).
#   it includes combs.inc (indirectly, via proxy.inc) with two more combinations
#   thus it should run 4 times
#
#   combs.combinations is overlayed in the example overlay, adding one more
#   combination. Thus simple.test must run two more times in the mtr-example.
#
#   Note that neither simple.test nor proxy.inc are touched by the overlay,
#   mtr needs to propagate "affected by the overlay" flag up the
#   inclusion chain.
