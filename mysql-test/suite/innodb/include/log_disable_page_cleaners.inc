# This script disables:
# - page cleaner threads,
# - threads which could assume that pages should have
#   been flushed eventually,
# - background threads which potentially could try to
#   modify a page,
# - checkpointing mechanism.
#
# This is a very useful utility in tests which need to freeze
# the checkpointing mechanism to fill the redo log. It allows
# to do that avoiding risk that some background thread could
# be awaiting for checkpoint advanced.

# Disable background threads that could modify pages.
