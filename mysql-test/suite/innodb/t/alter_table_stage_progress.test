# If the SELECT below fails with an empty result or missing rows, then maybe
# 'events_stages_history' filled up - only the most recent N events are
# displayed in it. If this happens, then maybe N newer evets were generated
# after the 'stage/innodb/alter table%' events which we expect to show up below.
# If this:
# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM performance_schema.events_stages_history;
# is near the limit specified in alter_table_stage_progress-master.opt and
# rows are missing from the SELECT below, then the limit must be increased.
