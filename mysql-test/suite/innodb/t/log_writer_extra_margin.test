# This test forces InnoDB to behave in a wrong way by missing a lot of calls
# to the log_free_check(). The page flushing is disabled, so the log writer
# thread quickly enters its private so-called extra_margin. This results in
# a warning being emitted (verified by the test). Soon the log_writer runs
# out of space in the extra_margin. Then error is emitted (verified).

# Since then an attempt to update a row ends up in a hanging UPDATE query.

# This is a moment, which simulates the situation that could potentially
# have happened if some code-path was missing calls to the log_free_check()
# and the oldest dirty page became re-modified and latched preventing the
# last_checkpoint_lsn from being advanced (simulated by the disabled page
# cleaners for sake of simplicity). If that happened during ordinary workload,
# the only help can come from DBA, who needs to observe the warning / error
# that were emitted and resize the redo log, increasing its capacity.

# Therefore this is what is done in this test. The redo log becomes increased
# by 1MB. However page cleaners are still disabled so the redo log becomes
# filled again (verified). That happens without exiting the extra_margin
# meanwhile, because the extra_margin is slightly bigger than 1MB.

# Then the page cleaners are enabled and the hanging UPDATE becomes finished
# (verified). Then the original redo log capacity is restored and it might
# take some time but eventually the redo log should become resized down.

# A next UPDATE should be finished easily (verified).
