# This is the test for bug 51378. Unique index created
# through "create index" and "alter table add unique index"
# interfaces should not be treated as primary index if indexed
# columns contain one or more column prefix(es) (only prefix/part of
# the column is indexed)
# On the other hand, if there is a unique index covers all
# columns of a table, and they are non-null columns, and
# full length of the column are indexed, then this index
# will be created as primary index
# Following queries test various scenario, no mismatch
# error message should be printed.

# Create a table contains a BLOB column

# of the table, the index should not be treated as primary
# key because it indexes only first 31 bytes of col2.
# Thus it contains "column prefix", and will not be
# upgraded to primary index.
# There should not be mismatch message printed in the
# errorlog
