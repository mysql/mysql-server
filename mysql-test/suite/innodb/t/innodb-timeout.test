# and before either
# - the innodb_lock_wait_timeout was exceeded
#   -> connection b reap gets ER_LOCK_WAIT_TIMEOUT
# or
# - connection a commits, the lock disappears and the statement
#   of connection b finishes
#   -> connection b reap gets success + result set
# we see within information_schema.processlist for connection b a row
#    command  state        info
#    Query    Sending data select * from t1 for update
# The highest time value seen was @@innodb_lock_wait_timeout + 1.
# Please note that there is unfortunately nothing which says
# that we are just waiting for a lock.
