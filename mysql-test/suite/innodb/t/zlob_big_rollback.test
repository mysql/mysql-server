# Bug #29846292 ROLLBACK OF BIG TRANSACTION DUE TO CONFLICT REMAINS IN HUNG STATE
#
--source include/have_innodb_max_16k.inc

# In this scenario, we create a LOB which does not fit in the buffer pool, thus
# the rollback has to be smart about managing pages.
# In particular a buggy implementaiton which tries to keep all pages of the LOB
# in the memory until mini-transaction commits, will deadlock with itself at
# some point when trying to fetch next page of the LOB from storage to already
# fully saturated buffer pool.
