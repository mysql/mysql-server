# This is the essense of the scenario from the report in Bug#33724166.
# There are two rows:
# c0000 | c0003 | c0004 | partition
# ------+-------+-------+----------
# 123   | 12    | 0     | 5
# 122   | 13    | 0     | 2
#
# It's important that 5 is the last of 6 partitions.
# A buggy implementation, would keep the internal state after the loop
# over all partitions, and reuse this state when handling subsequent
# unlock request from Server layer - in other words, will use state
# of the locks of 5th partition 5, when reasoning about 2nd partition locks.
# The con1 is only used to create an X lock on row from 2nd partition, so that
# the con2 is forced to use semi-consistent read on it without a lock.
# The InnoDB should correctly track which row needed a lock and which didn't,
# during the initial phase of filling up the priority queue with one record from
# each partition, and then correctly handle unlock requests from Server layer,
# ignoring request for 2nd partition, and performing it for 5th partition only.

# Here again we have the same two rows:

# in the subsequent UPDATE query. Such reused lock should not be released even
# if a row doesn't match the UPDATE's WHERE condition, because this lock was
# explicitly needed for a previous SELECT. InnoDB should correctly track that
# it reused a lock for record in 2nd partition, but has created a new lock for
# the record in 5th partition - and the latter can be released.
