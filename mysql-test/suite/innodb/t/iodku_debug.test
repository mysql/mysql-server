# Test 1 :- Partial rollback of Insert (secondary Index):
# Pre condition-1: Secondary index has one unpurged delete marked key
#                  [say K1] that matches exactly with the key to be inserted
#                  (including cluster index key).
# Pre-condition-2: Secondary index has one committed key [say K2] that matches
#		   with the key to be inserted but with different cluster index key.

# Test: During Insert, secondary index entry [K1] is not updated (un-delete marked)
#       because of duplicate key [K2].In this case the transaction doesn't
#       hold implicit lock on secondary index key and partial rollback should
