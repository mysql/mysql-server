# InnoDB table from mysql.* database schema. In particular, we don't want
# any assertion failures.
# Make a list of names of tables to test.
# These are the InnoDB tables visible to the end user in mysql.* database.
# We exclude some table names from the list:
# - ndb_binlog_index is only available on builds with NDB Cluster
# - We exclude ACL tables as Server skips row locking, which is not
#   desirable for this test case.

  # We plan to create a deadlock cycle in a quite simple way:
  # 1. c1: locks at least one row in $name FOR UPDATE (let's call the row "A")
  # 2. c2: locks the row with id=10 in t1 FOR SHARE (let's call the row "B")
  # 3. c2: waits for a lock on the row "A" FOR UPDATE
  # 4. c1: now tries to lock the row "B" FOR UPDATE
  # However, if the table $name is initially empty, we need to first insert row "A",
  # to have something to work with.
  # This requires us to guess plauisible default values for all columns of "A".
  # We exploit that in sql-mode="" we can simply pass 0 for each column.
  # We simply count number of columns and prepare a string with that many
  # zeros.
  # Also, to force the c2 to be chosen as a victim, we ensure that c1 has
  # greater weight, by allowing it to lock more rows in t1 in step 4.
  # I am aware that these tests are fragile, so if it is costly to maintain them
  # please feel free to remove them - they were useful during development, but
  # probably not worth spending resources to keep them up-to-date.
