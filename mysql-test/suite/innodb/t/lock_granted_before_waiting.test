# Scenario in which a WAITING lock struct is first "cleared" because locks
# are moved to a different heap_no, and then "reused" for another GRANTED
# lock on a different heap_no, potentially leading to a violation of invariant
# that GRANTED locks should be in front of WAITING locks.

# 1. con1 gets GRANTED GAP+REC S lock on row id=3
# 2. con2 gets WAITING II lock on row id=3
# 3. con3 gets GRANTED X lock on row id=2000
# 4. con4 gets WAITING GAP+REC S lock on row id=2000
# 5. con3 inserts so many rows before row id=2000 that the page has to be split,
#    and the old lock struct of con4 is "cleared" and new WAITING lock for con4
#    is created on the new page
# 6. con3 commits releasing the lock on row id=2000, so con4 can continue now
#    con4 gets GRANTED GAP+REC S lock on row id=3 (and reuses the previously
#    "cleared" struct to achieve that)
#
# The queue for row id=3 contains:
#    <con1,GRANTED,GAP+REC S>, <con2,WAITING,II>, <con3,GRANTED,GAP_REC S>
# so to bring back the invariant that GRANTED are before WAITING, we need to
# move con3's lock to front.

# The CHAR(200) is just to make records large, so page split comes sooner.
