  # This test case aims to expose the problem in the lock_rec_has_to_wait_cats
  # namely, that it ignores locks held by a transaction which is a victim of
  # a deadlock.
  # This test case shows, that by ignoring these locks, another transaction,
  # (named "seer") can see modifications of rows made by "victim".
  # In particular the "victim" will UPDATE t1 SET val = 200 WHERE id =3;
  # and "seer" will UPDATE t1 SET val = val + 10 WHERE id = 3
  # which in a correct implementation should lead to the end value being 13,
  # but in this faulty implementation leads to val = 210, despite "victim"
  # being rolled back.
  # The scenario requires one more actor, called "too_big_to_fail", which is a
  # concurrent transaction, which causes deadlock with "victim", yet, as its
  # name suggests, is too big to fail, so "victim" gets sacrificed instead.
  # To resolve the deadlock, one of the locks held by victim is released,
  # and it so happens, that it is a lock for a gap before row 3,
  # which causes CATS implementation to consider all transactions waiting for
  # a lock on row 3. In particular "seer" waits for X lock for row 3,
  # and is granted this lock, despite "victim" holding another X lock for the
  # same row. This leads to "seer" seeing the val = 200, and proceeding
  # with its +10, and results in 210 to be permanently stored.
  # The timeline is as follows:
  # 1. too_big_to_fail becomes heavy, by creating a few rows
  # 2. too_big_to_fail obtains a lock for the gap before 3
  # 3. victim obtains a lock for the gap before 5
  # 4. victim updates row 3, and thus obtains X lock for row 3
  # 5. victim starts insert into the gap before 3, and waits for too_big_to_fail
  # 6. seer starts update of row 3, but has to wait for victim
  # 7. too_big_to_fail inserts into gap before 5, which causes deadlock
  # 8. the deadlock is resolved by removing the waiting insert intention lock,
  #    which was enqueued by the victim for the insert into gap before row 3
  # 9. the CATS algorithm grants lock for row 3 to seer
  # 10. seer finishes the update, with value 210

      # commits. The whole purpose of this test, is to demonstrate, that it will
      # be 210.
      # Since the next line blocks, we need to use --send, but we also want the

  # Now, too big to fail, will cause deadlock, which kills victim.
  # The reason for deadlock is that victim holds lock for gap before 5,
  # into which too_big_to_fail tries to insert, but at the same time
  # too_big_to_fail holds a lock for a gap before 3, into which
  # the victim tries to insert.
  # Since too_big_to_fail is heavier, it is victim that will be sacrificed.
  # In particular, the wait lock for gap before 3 will be removed immediately.
  # This in turn will cause a CATS implementation to check if there are any
  # transactions waiting for a lock on record with id 3 to be granted, and grant
  # them if possible.
  # Recall, that seer waits for X lock for record with id 3, to perform UPDATE,
  # and that victim holds X lock for the same record because of val = 200.
  # The bug in CATS will ignore the victim's X-lock (because victim transaction
  # was_chosen_as_deadlock_victim) and will grant the lock to seer, which will
