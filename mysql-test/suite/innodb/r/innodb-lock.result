# Old lock method (where LOCK TABLE was ignored by InnoDB) no longer
# works when LOCK TABLE ... WRITE is used due to fix for bugs #46272
# "MySQL 5.4.4, new MDL: unnecessary and bug #37346 "innodb does not
# detect deadlock between update and alter table".
# After WL#6671 "Improve scalability by not using thr_lock.c locks
# for InnoDB tables" was implemented it no longer works for LOCK TABLES
# ,,, READ as well.
# LOCK TABLES locks are now completely handled by MDL subsystem.
