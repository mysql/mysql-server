# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test the same test cases that in `suite/rpl/t/rpl_semi_sync.test` with the
# `replication_optimize_for_static_plugin_config` enabled.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# R1. All test described in `rpl_semi_sync.test` MUST pass with
#     `replication_optimize_for_static_plugin_config` enabled.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Set `$rpl_test_optimize_for_static_plugin_config` to `1`.
# 2. Include `rpl_semi_sync.test`
