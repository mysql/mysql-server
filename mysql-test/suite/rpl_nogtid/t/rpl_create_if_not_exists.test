# BUG#45574:
# SP: CREATE DATABASE|TABLE IF NOT EXISTS not binlogged if routine exists.
#
#   There is an inconsistency with DROP DATABASE|TABLE|EVENT IF EXISTS and
#   CREATE DATABASE|TABLE|EVENT IF NOT EXISTS. DROP IF EXISTS statements are
#   binlogged even if either the DB, TABLE or EVENT does not exist. In
#   contrast, Only the CREATE EVENT IF NOT EXISTS is binlogged when the EVENT
#   exists.  
#
#   This problem caused some of the tests to fail randomly on PB or PB2.
#
# Description: 
#   Fixed this bug by adding calls to write_bin_log in: 
#   mysql_create_db 
#   mysql_create_table_no_lock 
#   mysql_create_like_table 
#   create_table_from_items 
#
#   Test is implemented as follows: 
#   i) test each "CREATE IF NOT EXISTS" (DDL), found in MySQL 5.1 manual
#   exclude CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE, on existent objects; 
#
#  Note: 
#  rpl_create_tmp_table_if_not_exists.test tests CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE cases.

# BUG#47418 RBR fails, failure with mixup of base/temporary/view TABLE DDL
# 
# Before the patch for this bug, 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXIST ... SELECT'
# statement was binlogged as a TEMPORARY table if the object existed as
# a temporary table.  This was caused by that the temporary table was opened
# and the results of the 'SELECT' was inserted into the temporary table if
# a temporary table existed with the same name.
# 
# After the patch for this bug, the base table is created and the results of
# the 'SELECT' are inserted into it, even though a temporary table exists with
# the same name, and the statement is still binlogged as a base table.
