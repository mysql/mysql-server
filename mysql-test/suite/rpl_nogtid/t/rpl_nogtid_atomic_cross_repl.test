# ==== Purpose ====
# The test considers scenarios of OLD -> NEW replication, where NEW stands
# for WL9175-based slave server, and OLD is of a prior version master.
# This file consists of cases that need GTID=OFF.

# It's proved that the slave applier stops with an expected error
# of mismatch between one that is recorded on master and the actual.
# The slave applier does not update the execution coordinates so
# at retry when the error simulation is withdrawn the event must
# complete to good.
