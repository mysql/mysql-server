DATE_TIME [Warning] [Repl] Replica SQL for channel '': ... The replica coordinator and worker threads are stopped, possibly leaving data in inconsistent state. A restart should restore consistency automatically, although using non-transactional storage for data or info tables or DDL queries could lead to problems. In such cases you have to examine your data (see documentation for details). Error_code: ER_MTA_INCONSISTENT_DATA
