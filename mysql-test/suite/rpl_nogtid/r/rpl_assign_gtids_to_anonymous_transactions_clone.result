Warnings:
Note	####	Sending passwords in plain text without SSL/TLS is extremely insecure.
Note	####	Storing MySQL user name or password information in the master info repository is not secure and is therefore not recommended. Please consider using the USER and PASSWORD connection options for START SLAVE; see the 'START SLAVE Syntax' in the MySQL Manual for more information.

Warnings:
Note	4017	Using ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS creates limitations on the replication topology - you cannot fail over between downstream and upstream servers. Only use this option if it is not possible to enable GTIDs on the source, for instance, because of lack of permissions. If possible, use the procedure for enabling GTID transactions online instead, as described in the documentation.
