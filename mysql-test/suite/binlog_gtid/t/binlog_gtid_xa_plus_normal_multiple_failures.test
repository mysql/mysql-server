# ==== Purpose ====
#
# The goal is to have a variety of different transaction types paused
# at different phases of the commit pipeline, then crash and restart
# the server, and verify that the recovery took the expected action
# for each transaction.
#
# More precisely, we test the following 5 transaction types:
# - COMMIT
# - XA PREPARE
# - XA COMMIT ... ONE PHASE,
# - XA COMMIT
# - XA ROLLBACK (for a prepared transaction)
#
# For each such transaction type, we execute 4 different transactions
# of the type, each one paused on one of the following sync points:
# - before_command_dispatch (no persistent changes yet)
# - before_invoke_before_commit_hook (prepared in engine, not broadcast)
# - bgc_after_enrolling_for_flush_stage (prepared in engine, broadcast,
#   but not written to binlog)
# - bgc_after_enrolling_for_sync_stage (prepared in engine, broadcast,
#   written to binlog, but not committed in engine)
#
# After restart, we verify that:
# - The table contains the rows that we expect have committed.
# - XA RECOVER shows the transactino that we expect to have in
#   prepared state.
# - The error log contains a message that mentions the number
#   internally coordinated and the number of externally coordinated
#   transactions, that committed, rolled back, and prepared.
# - gtid_executed contains the GTIDs of the transactions we expect
#   to have rolled forward during recovery.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Iterate over all 5*4 transactions; for those that are of type
#    XA COMMIT or XA ROLLBACK, execute the preceding part of the
#    transaction, up to XA PREPARE.
#
# 2. Iterate over all 4 sync points. In each iteration, execute one
#    transaction of each kind, and wait for it to reach the sync
#    point.
#
#    Also track the expected outcome of the transaction: if it is
#    expected to commit, remember that the row shall be expected to be
#    found in the table later.  If it is expected to be in prepared
#    state after recovery, remember that the row shall be found in XA
#    RECOVER later.  If recovery is expected to take action to commit,
#    rollback, or prepare the transaction, increase a counter of
#    committed, rolled back, or prepared transactions accordingly;
#    these numbers will later be found in a log message.
#
# 3. Crash and restart.
#
# 4. Verify the prepared transactions are the expected ones: Use
#    save_result_in_table.inc to store the resultset from XA RECOVER
#    in a table; use GROUP_CONCAT to concatenate all the prepared XIDs
#    into one string; compare this string with one prepared in step 2
#    above.
#
# 5. Verify the table contents is the expected one: Use GROUP_CONCAT to
#    concatenate all rows in the table to one string; compare this
#    string with one prepared in step 2 above.
#
# 6. Verify the log messages are as expected: Use the counters
#    computed in step 2 above to predict the summary message we expect
#    to see in the log; verify that the message is actually there.
#
# 7. Verify the first five transactions are committed; by the way we
#    iterate, we ensure that the first 5 transactions will be
#    completed after recovery, and the others will not.  Therefore,
#    the first 5 GTIDs are expected in gtid_executed, and the
#    remaining ones are not.

# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Execute one transaction and pause it at a given sync point during the
# transaction-ending statement.
#
# ==== Usage ====
#
# --let $n = NUMBER
# --let $pre_statement = <SQL>
# --let $statement = <SQL>
# --let $sync_point = NAME
# --let $before = {R|P}
# --let $after = {R|P|C}
# --let $action = {complete|undo|none}
#
# Parameters:
#   $n
#     A sequence number; should be 1 before the first invocation,
#     will be incremented by 1 by each invocation. This is used for
#     the GTID, the XID, and the TIMESTAMP for the transaction.
#
#   $pre_statement
#     Statement(s) to execute within the transaction, prior to the
#     one that shall be paused.
#
#   $statement
#     The statement that shall be paused on a sync point.
#
#   $sync_point
#     The conditional timestamp sync point that $statement shall pause.
#
#   $before
#     The state of the transaction before this script is invoked:
#     R - the transaction is not started ("rollback")
#     P - the transaction is prepared
#
#   $after
#     The state of the transaction in case $statement would succeed:
#     R - the transaction is rolled back
#     P - the transaction is prepared
#     C - the transaction is committed
#
#   $action
#     The expected outcome of the transaction:
#
#     "complete" - the transaction will complete during recovery,
#       reaching the state specified in $after.  This should be used
#       if $sync_point occurs after the conceptual commit point.
#
#     "undo" - the transaction will be undone during recovery,
#       reaching the state specified in $before.  This should be used
#       if $sync_point occurs after the transaction has invoked the
#       engine but before the conceptual commit point.
#
#     none - the transaction will not be found during recovery, and
#       remain in the state specified in $before.  This should be used
#       if $sync_point occurs before the transaction has invoked the
#       engine.
#
#   $is_xa
#     Should be set to 1 if this is an XA transaction, 0 if this is
#     an internally coordinated transaction.
#
# Output variables:
#   $n
#     The number $n will be incremented by 1.
#
#   $expect_prepared
#     String listing the transactions that we expect being in prepared
#     state after recovery.  If this transaction should be in prepared
#     state after recovery, as determined by $before, $after, and
#     $action, the script will append a space character followed by $n
#     to $expect_prepared.
#
#   $expect_rows
#     String listing the transactions that we expect being in
#     committed state after recovery.  If this transaction should be
#     in committed after recovery, as determined by $before, $after,
#     and $action, the script will append a space character followed
#     by $n to $expect_rows.
#
#   $xa_committed, $xa_prepared, $xa_rolled_back
#     If the current transaction is an XA transaction which we expect
#     that the recovery procedure will take action to
#     {commit|prepare|rollback}, this script increments
#     {$xa_committed|$xa_prepared|$xa_rolled_back}.
#
#   $internal_committed, $internal_rolled_back
#     If the current transaction is an internally coordinated (non-XA)
#     transaction which we expect that the recovery procedure will
#     take action to {commit|rollback}, this script increments
#     {$xa_committed|$xa_rolled_back}.
