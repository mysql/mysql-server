# ==== Purpose ====
#
# If re-prepare of a prepared statement or statement in stored program is
# triggered then gtid_next should not be updated. Tests in this file verifies
# gtid_next value update with prepared statement and stored procedure
# re-prepare. Re-prepare statement code is same for all the stored programs. So
# behavior is verified with only stored procedure in this file.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# When a session has set GTID_NEXT to a UUID:NUMBER and AUTOCOMMIT is enabled,
# the following requirements shall hold:
#
#  R1. If a statement is re-prepared, it shall leave GTID_NEXT unchanged:
#
#      R1.1. For prepared statements (EXECUTE)
#      R1.2. For stored procedures (CALL)
#
#  R2. If a statement exhausts the re-prepare count so that it fails with
#      ER_NEED_REPREPARE, it shall set GTID_NEXT to UNDEFINED:
#
#      R2.1. For prepared statements (EXECUTE)
#      R2.2. For stored procedures (CALL)
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
#  Initialize
#  	a) create table
#  	b) create prepared statement and stored procedure using table created
#          in step a.
#
#  1) Verify behavior with a prepared statement
#       1.1)  SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       1.2)  Execute prepared statement.
#       1.3)  SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       1.4)  Truncate table so that table version is updated.
#       1.5)  SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       1.6)  Re-execute prepared statement. Statement re-prepare is triggered
#             as table version is changed. This operation should *not* invalidate
#             gtid_next.
#
#  2) Verify behavior with a stored procedure.
#       2.1) SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       2.2) Execute stored procedure.
#       2.3) SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       2.4) Truncate table so that table version is updated.
#       2.5) SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       2.6) Re-execute stored procedure. Statement re-prepare is triggered as
#            table version is changed. This operation should *not* invalidate
#            gtid_next.
#
#  3) Verify behavior with a prepared statement in stored procedure.
#       3.1) SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       3.2) Execute stored procedure.
#       3.3) SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       3.4) Truncate table so that table version is updated.
#       3.5) SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       3.6) Re-execute stored procedure. Statement re-prepare is triggered as
#            table version is changed. This operation should *not* invalidate
#            gtid_next.
#
#  4) Verify behavior with a prepared statement in max re-prepare hit situation.
#       4.1) SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       4.2) Execute prepared statement.
#       4.3) SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       4.4) Truncate table so that table version is updated.
#       4.5) SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       4.6) Simulate max prepared statement re-prepare hit condition.
#       4.7) Re-execute prepared statement. Statement re-prepare is triggered as
#            table version is changed. This operation fails and gtid_next is
#            invalidated.
#
#  5) Verify behavior with a stored procedure in max re-prepare hit situation.
#       5.1) SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       5.2) Execute stored procedure.
#       5.3) SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       5.4) Truncate table so that table version is updated.
#       5.5) SET gtid_next = UUID:NUMBER
#       5.6) Simulate max prepared statement re-prepare hit condition.
#       5.7) Re-execute stored procedure. Statement re-prepare is triggered as
#            table version is changed. This operation fails and gtid_next is
#            invalidated.
