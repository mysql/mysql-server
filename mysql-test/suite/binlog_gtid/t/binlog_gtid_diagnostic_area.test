# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test the server behaviour when 'READ ONLY' transaction mode is enabled for a
# session and the binary log has to be rotated.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# R1. If session transaction read only mode is enabled and binlog rotation is
#     triggered then it MUST succeed.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1) Create a table
# 2) Set 'SESSION TRANSACTION READ ONLY'
# 3) Execute 'SET GLOBAL BINLOG_CHECKSUM = CRC32' and assert that binary log
#    was rotated..
# 4) Try executing an INSERT in READ ONLY transaction mode, it should fail with
#    below error
# 5) SET SESSION TRANSACTION READ WRITE and execute an INSERT.
# 6) Set 'SESSION TRANSACTION READ ONLY'
# 7) Execute 'FLUSH BINARY LOGS', verify that gtid_executed table was updated
#    and assert that binary log was rotated.
# 8) SET SESSION TRANSACTION READ WRITE and drop the table
# 9) Disable the clone gtid persister thread, in order to make sure that
#    mysql.gtid_executed table is updated only via flush logs.
# 10)Verify that we report any error which might occur while accessing
#    or modifying gtid_executed table.
