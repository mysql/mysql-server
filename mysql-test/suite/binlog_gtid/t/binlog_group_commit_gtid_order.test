# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test will evaluate if a set of transactions being applied as
# a group will apply their GTIDs in order, avoiding temporary creation
# of gaps in gtid_executed.
#
# The test pause two inserts in the same commit group, letting the
# second insert (greater GTID number) to finish first.
#
# The test also assert that the gtid_executed::free_intervals_mutex
# is not used as no gap was generated in gtid_executed.
#
