This directory includes a set of three test suites aimed as testing functionality
in an engine independent way, that is - the tests should work identically against
different engines.


The following suites are included:

1) 'funcs' suite
   -------------
   A collection of functional tests covering basic engine and server functionality that can be run
   against iany engine.

   To run the test suite:
      cd INSTALL_DIR/mysql-test
      run: perl ./mysql-test-run.pl --suite=engines/funcs --mysqld=--default-storage-engine=<engine>

2) 'iuds' suite
   ------------
   Similar to the above focused on insert/update/delete operations of different different data types.

   To run the test suite:
      cd INSTALL_DIR/mysql-test
      run: perl ./mysql-test-run.pl --suite=engines/iuds --mysqld=--default-storage-engine=<engine>

3) 'rr_trx' suite (transactional engines only)
   --------------
   A scenario of multiple client connections verifying transactions with repeatable read isolation level

   To run the test suite with innodb:
      cd INSTALL_DIR/mysql-test
      run: perl ./suite/engines/rr_trx/run_stress_tx_rr.pl --engine=<engine> [--duration=<nn>]
                                                          [--threads=<nn>] [--try] [--help] 

   This test is can be run against any transactional engine. However scripts need to be modified in order
   to support such engines (current scripts support only InnoDB).
   In order to add support for a new engine, you will need to modify scripts as follows:
   1) cd to INSTALL_DIR/mysql-test/suite/engines/rr_trx
   2) Modify the 'run_stress_rr.pl' file by adding an 'elsif' section for your engine and have it
      include specific values required to be passed as startup parameters to the MySQL server by
      specifying them using "--mysqld" options (see InnoDB example).
   3) Copy the 'init_innodb.txt' file to 'init_<engine>.txt file and change its content to be "init_<engine>".
   4) In the 't' directory copy the "init_innodb.test" file to "init_<engine>.test" and change the value of
      the '$engine' variable to <engine>.
   5) In the 'r' directory copy "the init_innodb.result" file to "init_<engine>.result" and change refrences
      to 'InnoDB' to <engine>.


Known Issues
------------
1) The folowing tests in the 'iuds' suite:
     - delete_decimal
     - insert_decimal 
     - update_decimal
   will return a 'Warning 1264 - Out of range value...' warning if run in a 32-bit environment.
   Add the '--force' option to prevent the test run from aborting.

2) The following tests in the 'funcs' suite will fail when run against the innodb_plugin:
   - crash_manycolumns_string (bug 50495) 
   - ix_unique_lob (bug 52056, masked by an 'Out of memory error' on some 32-bit platforms)
   - ix_unique_string_length (bug 52056, masked by an 'Out of memory error' on some 32-bit platforms)
   Add the '--force' option to prevent the test run from aborting.

3) Some of the rpl_xxx tests in the 'funcs' suite require a secific binlog_forat setting and will be
   skipped otherwise.
 
4) Some of the rpl_xxx tests in the 'funcs' suite will report a 'Statement unsafe for replication' warning 
   when run againsr a server configured to use statement based replication.
