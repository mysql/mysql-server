# This test checks that the slave I/O thread refuses to start if slave
# and master have the same server id (because this is a useless setup,
# and otherwise SHOW SLAVE STATUS shows progress but all queries are
# ignored, which has caught our customers), unless
# --replicate-same-server-id.

insert into t1 values (1);
# can't MASTER_POS_WAIT(), it does not work in this weird setup
# (when slave is its own master without --replicate-same-server-id)
sleep 2; # enough time for the event to be replicated (it should not)
