# This test is to verify that DROP TEMPORARY TABLE
# is automatically binlogged and sent to slave
# when a temp table is dropped by disconnection
# of a master's conection.
# So it does not apply to row-based, where we neither need
# nor do this automatic binlogging. And if we run this test
# in row-based, it hangs waiting for an offset which is never
# reached (the "sync_with_master 1"), logically.
