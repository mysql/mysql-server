# See if "LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE" is well replicated
# (LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE is not written to the binlog
# the same way as LOAD DATA INFILE : Append_blocks are smaller).
# In MySQL 4.0 <4.0.12 there were 2 bugs with LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE :
# - the loaded file was not written entirely to the master's binlog,
# only the first 4KB, 8KB or 16KB usually.
# - the loaded file's first line was not written entirely to the
# master's binlog (1st char was absent)
