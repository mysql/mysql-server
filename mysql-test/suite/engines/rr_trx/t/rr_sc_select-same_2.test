# This test contains a single transaction performing queries against the test
# data. The main purpose is to test REPEATABLE READ results, that is to verify
# that reads (SELECTs) are indeed repeatable during a REPEATABLE READ 
# transaction. 
#
# Generally, queries which should yield the same results at one moment in time 
# should also yield the same results later in the same transaction. In some 
# configurations, however, phantom reads are allowed (may e.g. depend on 
# settings such as falcon_consistent_read).
#
# To detect missing rows, modified rows and possibly invalid (uncommitted) 
# extra (phantom) rows, we store query results in temporary tables and compare 
# using special queries. Using includes for this to avoid unnecessary "clutter"
# in each select-only test.
#
# This and similar tests (transactions) should contain some random "filler"
# between the SELECTs so that they may run in different conditions, such as:
#   * some other transactions may have commited in the meantime
#   * a scavenge run may have happened (falcon)
#   * etc
#
# Such a "random filler" can be:
#   * SLEEP()
#   * Bogus updates on some unrelated temporary table that was created for the purpose
#   * savepoint + bogus updates on the main tables + rollback to savepoint
#   * Inserts on new records (which will show up as "phantom" records in subsequent SELECTs)
