# Verify the sys.innodb_lock_waits view

# TODO: Bug#30760026.
# View metadata updates make the view columns after
# the first server restart different from what they look
# like after an upgrade, because the view meta data update
# triggered by the storing of the DD meta data for the
# underlying entities is done using sql_mode=0, which
# is different from the sql_mode used during CREATE
# (i.e. the default sql_mode).
#
# As a short term fix, to avoid noise from test runs,
# we mask the values that become different in order to
# get deterministic results. This short term fix should
# be removed when the underlying issue is fixed.
