# BUG#25379659 MASTER MAY BINLOG A WRONG LAST_COMMITED
#
# Transactions could binlog a last_commited smaller than expected. With the
# wrong last_commited values, the transactions which sould be applied
# sequentially could be applied parallel. That caused applier errors or data
#  inconsistency.
#
# When committing a transaction, its last_commited is set to the value of
# max_committed_transaction. max_committed_transaction is the maximum
# sequence_number of committed transactions. It is maintained just before
# committing each transaction to engine. If its sequence_number is not
# SEQ_UNINIT then updates max_committed_transaction accordingly.
#
# However, it checked wrong sequence_number(the sequence_number of the
# leader thread's transaction instead of the sequence_number of the transaction).
# That caused that max_committed_transaction was only updated in time for leader
# thread's transaction. The update for following transactions were delay to
# finish_commit() which was after the transaction commited to engine.
#
# The test verifys last_committed is corret in the bug situation.
#
# Step 1. Use debug sync to gurantee that commit queue has two transactions.
# Step 2. Use debug sync to pause the second transaction when it enters
#         finshi_commit()
# Step 3. Execute a transaction and check if its last_committed is correct.
