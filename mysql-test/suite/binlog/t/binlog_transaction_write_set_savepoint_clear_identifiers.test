# This test confirm that all information about SAVEPOINT identifiers is erased
# after a COMMIT or ROLLBACK
#
# Test:
#   0. Enable debug point that asserts that when adding a SAVEPOINT it's the
#   only one on savepoint map
#   1. Create a table to insert data
#   2. Commit a transaction and verify that when created a SAVEPOINT was the only
#   one identifier
#   3. Rollback a transaction and verify that when created a SAVEPOINT was the only
#   one identifier
#   4. Commit a transaction and verify that when created a SAVEPOINT was the only
#   one identifier
