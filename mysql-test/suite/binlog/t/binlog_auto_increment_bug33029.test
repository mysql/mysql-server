# BUG#33029 5.0 to 5.1 replication fails on dup key when inserting
# using a trig in SP

# For all 5.0 up to 5.0.58 exclusive, and 5.1 up to 5.1.12 exclusive,
# if one statement in a SP generated AUTO_INCREMENT value by the top
# statement, all statements after it would be considered generated
# AUTO_INCREMENT value by the top statement, and a erroneous INSERT_ID
# value might be associated with these statement, which could cause
# duplicate entry error and stop the slave.

# Test if the slave can replicate from such a buggy master

# The bug33029-slave-relay-bin.000001 file is the
# slave-replay-bin.000003 file generated by run the
# rpl_auto_increment_bug33029.test with clean up statements at the end
# of the test case removed on a buggy 5.0 server

source include/have_log_bin.inc;

# Need to restore this at the end; CHANGE MASTER modifies it (see the
# manual for CHANGE MASTER).
