# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test asserts that when a performance schema table is dropped, only the
# missing table is marked as invalid when the server is restarted with binlog
# enabled.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# On a server with binlog enabled, drop a performance_schema table.Then, restart
# the server also with binlog enabled.
# Assert that the correct error message is printed in the server error log
# (because if any other error is issued, the test fails).
