# Test that tests the crash of server in a particular combination of
# temporary tables and user defined variable
#
# Here we tests the crash of server when temporary tables are dropped
# immediately after a query which has an user defined variable.
#
#
#
# Test guide:
#   1) Create a normal table and a temporary table.
#   2) Create a user defined variable.
#   3) Execute a transaction in normal table involving the user defined
#      variable.
#   4) Disconnect this connection, this will end up calling the cleanup
#      method which drops all the temporary tables created in that connection
#   5) Cleanup
#
# This test case is specific to binlog_format=statement

--let $connection_id= `SELECT connection_id()`
CREATE TABLE t1 (id INT);
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE t2(id INT);
SET @id := 1;
DELETE FROM t1 WHERE id LIKE @id;

disconnect con1;

# Wait till the session con1 is disconnected
--let $wait_condition = SELECT COUNT(*) = 0 FROM information_schema.processlist WHERE  id = '$connection_id'
