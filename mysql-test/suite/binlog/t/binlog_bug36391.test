# BUG#36391 and BUG#38731
#
# The fix for BUG#20103 "Escaping with backslash does not work as expected"
# was implemented too greedy though in that it not only changes the behavior
# of backslashes within strings but in general, so disabling command shortcuts
# like \G or \C (which in turn leads to BUG#36391: "mysqlbinlog creates invalid charset statements".
#
# The test executes simple commands that are stored in the binary log and
# re-execute them through the mysql client which should have to process
# some command shortcuts. The backslashes within strings is disabled in the file
# rpl_bug36391-master.opt by the option --sql_mode=NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES.
