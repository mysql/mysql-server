# Bug#27041759 RESET MASTER WHILE A TRX IN BGC(AFTER FLUSH) LEAVING SERVER IN
#              BAD GTID TATE
#
# Problem: When a transaction is in Binlog group commit, (flush stage is done
#          but third stage, commit stage, is not done yet), if some one executes
#          RESET BINARY LOGS AND GTIDS, binlog will not contain the transaction (it will be
#          cleared by RESET BINARY LOGS AND GTIDS), but after the transaction is committed,
#          transaction gtid is added to gtid_executed. And this gtid cannot be
#          utilized by server again even though the transaction is already
#          cleared from the binlog. This leaves the server in bad gtid state.
#
# Step to reproduce:
# ------------------
#
#  Step-1) Initial Setup which is required for the test.
#  Step-2) Execute a transaction that will wait for a signal
#          at various stages of commit. Then execute 'RESET BINARY LOGS AND GTIDS'
#          and observe binlog contents and GTID state. Repeat
#          the step when 'global read lock' is already acquired
#          by either the same thread or by some other thread
#          before executing 'RESET BINARY LOGS AND GTIDS'.
#  Step-3) Test error cases
#  Step-4) Cleanup
