# ====== Purpose =======
#
# This test verifies that DROP for a temporary table created
# in Statement mode is logged in binlog at session disconnect.
#
# ====== Implementation ======
#
# Create temporary tables in statement mode using different engines,
# now when you connect to the session after a disconnect print the
# output of show binlog events.
# This will verify that the DROP for temporary table created in stmt
# mode is written to binary log at session disconnect.

# ====== Purpose =======
#
# This test verifies that DROP for a temporary table created
# in Row mode is not logged in binlog at session disconnect.
#
# ====== Implementation ======
#
# Create temporary tables in statement or mixed mode using different engines,
# also create a temporary table in Row mode, now when you connect to the session
# after a disconnect print the output of show binlog events.
# This will verify that the DROP for temporary table created in stmt or mixed
# mode is written to binary log at session disconnect, but for  the temporary table
# created in Row mode no DROP statement for temporary table is logged at session
# disconnect.
