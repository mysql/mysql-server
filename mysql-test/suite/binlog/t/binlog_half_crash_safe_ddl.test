# ==== Purpose ====
# Prove successful server recovery after simulated crash while
# there were general DDL queries in processing.
# The test is destined for eventual merge with binlog_crash_safe_ddl.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
# Closely follows @c see binlog_crash_safe_ddl.test.
#
# Unlike the referred (mostly) acl specific file this one provides merely
# "stub" checks after some of simulated crashes for cases that are not fully
# 2pc-ready.
# TODO: WL#9536 to refine, complete or reuse
# the stub checks.
#
# ==== References ====
# WL#9175  Correct recovery of DDL statements/transactions by binary log
# WL#9536 is responsible for adding  to 2pc support to some
# of DDL:s. The current testing skips the crash-recovery testing in those case
# with tagging them as todo objects for a host WL.
#
# ==== Exempts ====
# The following DDL commands are excluded from testing:
#
# SERVER (Create etc)
# An excerpt from Docs: In MySQL 5.7, 'CREATE SERVER' is not written to the binary log,
# regardless of the logging format that is in use.
#
# LOGFILE-GROUP (Create etc)
# Not supported by Innodb.
#
# ALTER TABLESPACE
# Not supported by Innodb.
#
# === Limitations ===
# --force-restart is required to run the test.
#
# When the object deletion was interrupted by crash
# there could be errors on object recreation attempt like
# 1007: Can't create database '...'; database exists
# due to
# Bug #25663287 DROP DATABASE DOESN'T GETS RECOVERED CORRECTLY UPON POST BINLOG CRASH/RESTART
# or asserts like in
# Bug #25651042 TANSACTION DOES NOT POST-CRASH RECOVER IN INNODB EVEN IF PREPARED AND BINLOGGED
