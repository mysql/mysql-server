#==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that there is no crash in the server while executing the command
# INSERT..SELECT..LIMIT on a partitioned table in binlog_format='mixed'.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Create a partitioned table 'employees' and insert a row in it.
# 2. Create a non-partitioned table t1 and insert a row in it.
# 3. Execute the command INSERT..SELECT..LIMIT on partition table
#    employees.
# 4. Execute SHOW BINLOG EVENTS command to ensure the server didn't crash.
# 5. Clean up.
#
# ==== References ====

# Bug#29170679:ASSERT FAILURE IN EXECUTING INSERT..SELECT..LIMIT STMT IN PARTITION TABLE IN MBR

# Run this test in mixed mode as that is where the crash is seen.
