To run the memcached test you have to download and install the Memcached.pm module in Perl.
It has to be installed in the Cache directory. 

Each test in memcached is connecting to the memcached daemon with an IP and a port.
The default IP is "127.0.0.1" and the default port number is 11211. Others can be used by setting the daemon_option -p, e.g. -p11212. Each test is connectiing with an own port number to be able to run in parallel to other memcached tests. The names of the memcached tests have the form memcXXX_... where XXX are the last 3 digits of the port number. The first 2 digits are "11", means the test "memc212_..." is uses the port "11212".
As the port number should be clear use a not yet assigned port number for the test you want to add.
