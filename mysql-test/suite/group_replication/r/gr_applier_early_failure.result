# 4. Stop server 2 and start it again. One of three things can happen:
#  A. The applier fails after the join and the member leaves the group
#     but the START GROUP_REPLICATION command does not fail
#  B. The applier fails after initialization and sets the state to ERROR,
#     making the group join fail that makes the START GROUP_REPLICATION
#     command fail with a generic ER_GROUP_REPLICATION_CONFIGURATION.
#  C. The applier fails and its initialization processes catches the error.
#     During the start, it is known that the applier failed so the START
#     GROUP_REPLICATION fails with: ER_GROUP_REPLICATION_APPLIER_INIT_ERROR
#
