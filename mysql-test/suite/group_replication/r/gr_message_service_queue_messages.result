SELECT group_replication_service_message_send("tag", "Server2 sent a message");

# 6. To decrease failure rate on assert_grep we do a transaction with
#    AFTER consistency to add some rounds on GCS communication and stop GR on
#    server1, which will make it wait for the delivery of new view, and
#    that will happen only after delivery of service message. This will
#    give some time to server to receive and write it to error log.
