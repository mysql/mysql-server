## 1.  Verify lower_case_table_names cannot be set while server is
##     running and start GR on server-1.

## 2.  Store variables of server-2 for restart.

call mtr.add_suppression("lower_case_table_names was set to 2, .*");
set session sql_log_bin=1;

## 3A. Test GR does not start on boot when lower_case_table_names
##     does not match. And verifies only one member is shown in the
##     group as the join failed.
