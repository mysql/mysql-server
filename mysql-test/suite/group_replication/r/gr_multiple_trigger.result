#1. Create tables and a trigger t1_b on master.
[connection server1]
CREATE TABLE t1 (a INT PRIMARY KEY);

create trigger t1_b
after insert on t1
for each row
BEGIN
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (New.a, @value1);

#2. Check that action_order attribute of trigger t1_b is same on both servers.
include/assert.inc [action_order for trigger t1_b must be 1.]
