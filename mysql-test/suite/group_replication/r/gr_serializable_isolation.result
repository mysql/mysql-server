## 1. Create table and insert some sample data to do some DML operations
CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY) ENGINE=InnoDB;
INSERT INTO t1 VALUE (1);
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp1 (c1 INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY) ENGINE=InnoDB;
INSERT INTO temp1 VALUE (1);

## 2. Change Isolation level to SERIALIZABLE.
SET @transaction_isolation_orig = @@session.transaction_isolation;
SET SESSION transaction_isolation='SERIALIZABLE';

## 3. DDLs are allowed irrespective of transaction isolation value
CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY) ENGINE=InnoDB;

## 4. DMLs should be blocked if isolation level is SERIALIZABLE.
