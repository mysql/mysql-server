# This test verifies that when a view is received after the STOP
# GROUP_REPLICATION has terminated but plugin is still installed,
# the view is properly handled.
#
# To test that we start a two members group, disable the wait for
# view install on member 2 leave and leave the group.
#
# Test:
# 0. The test requires two servers: M1 and M2.
# 1. With both members ONLINE. Set DEBUG point in M2 to disable the wait for
#    view change.
# 2. Stop GR on M2.
# 3. Set DEBUG point to timeout on wait for view after joining group.
# 4. Start GR on M2. Expect error.
# 5. Wait for M2 to go OFFLINE.
