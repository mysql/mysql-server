# This test validates that in a group with two members, if one of the members
# goes away, the group will block. In addition, it also checks that if the
# group is forcefully reconfigured the system will resume operations.
#
# It is a variation of other reconfiguration tests that we have deployed
# already, except that this tests the case of 2 servers only.
#
# The test does the following:
# 0. The test requires two servers: server1 and server2.
# 1. Bootstrap start group on server1. Start GR on server2. Create table on
#   server2 for replicating data.
# 2. Crashes one server: server2.
# 3. Issue a transaction on the server1 that is still up and validate that it
#    blocks (best effort test).
# 4. Validate that the group configuration still shows up as two servers.
# 5. Unblock the group by reconfiguring it forcefully to a single server.
# 6. Check that the pending transaction was unblocked.
# 7. Validate that the configuration is now a single server.
# 8. Issue a new transaction and validate that it completes.
# 9. Join server2 again.
# 10. Check that the group configuration has changed on both servers.
# 11. Check that the contents of the replicated table are in sync.
