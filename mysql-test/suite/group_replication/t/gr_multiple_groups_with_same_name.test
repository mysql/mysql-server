# Verify that multiple groups are possible with same group name.
#
# Test:
# 0. The test requires three servers.
# 1. Bootstrap start GR on three servers.
# 2. Verify that three groups with one member on each group with same group name
#    are formed.
# 3. Upon restarting GR without bootstrap on server2 and server3. Only one group
#    with three members will be formed.
