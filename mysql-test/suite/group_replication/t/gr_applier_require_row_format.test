# ==== Purpose ====
#
# To verify that `REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` option is not settable for GR channels and
# that the option has default value to `1`.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1) Stop the applier for `server1`.
# 2) Verify that is not possible to change `REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` option
# 3) Verify that `REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT` is set for the GR channels.
