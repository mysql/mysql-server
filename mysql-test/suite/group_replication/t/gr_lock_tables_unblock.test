# This test verifies that during in GR the set super_read_only is blocked
# due to a table being locked. Subsequently, an unlock of the table in another
# connection will unblock the setting of super_read_only mode and the recovery
# proceeds further.
#
# Test:
# 0. The test requires two servers: M1 and M2.
# 1. With both members ONLINE. Group replication is then blocked on one of
#    the node M1.
# 2. Add some data on the remaining member of the GROUP.
# 3. On the member which is not a member of the GROUP lock the table and start
#    GR so that it enters the recovering stage. This should be blocked as the
#    set super_read_only cannot execute further.
# 4. In another connection unlock the tables and see that the recovery proceeds
#    and the data exists on the two members.
# 5. Clean up.
