#
# Starting from communication protocol version 8.0.22, XCom will use a single
# leader consensus algorithm based on Multi-Paxos when running GR in SPM.
#
# This test shall verify that, upon switching the group mode from MPM to SPM,
# when on communication protocol v8.0.22, a single leader is used. It will also
# test that when switching from MPM to SPM while using a previous communication
# protocol, the previous consensus algorithm is used (i.e. all members as
# leaders).
#
# Test:
# 0) The test requires three servers.
# 1) Switch to SPM on every member. For each member that was elected as primary
# in SPM, the WRITE_CONSENSUS_LEADERS_MEMBER_ID_PREFERRED and
# WRITE_CONSENSUS_LEADERS_MEMBER_ID_ACTIVE fields of the
# performance_schema.replication_group_communication_information PFS table
# should contain *only* the UUID of that member.
# 2) Change the communication protocol to 8.0.21.
# 3) Switch to SPM on every member. For each member that was elected as primary
# in SPM the WRITE_CONSENSUS_LEADERS_MEMBER_ID_PREFERRED and
# WRITE_CONSENSUS_LEADERS_MEMBER_ID_ACTIVE fields of the
# performance_schema.replication_group_communication_information PFS table
# should contain the UUIDs of *all* the members in the group.
# 4) Cleanup.
