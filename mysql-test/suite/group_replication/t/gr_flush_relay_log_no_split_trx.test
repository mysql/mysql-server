# ==== Purpose ====
#
# The purpose of this script is to test that a `FLUSH RELAY LOG` doesn't split
# transactions among two different relay logs.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# R1. A request for flushing the relay logs WILL be postponed if there is an
#     ongoing transaction.
#
# R2. Once the given ongoing transaction comes to an end, the relay logs MUST be
#     flushed.
#
# R3. The client or channel that requested the relay logs flush MUST be blocked
#     and in wait until the actual flush is finished.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1) Add a debug sync point that holds and makes the applier thread to wait, in
#    the middle of a transaction - `signal.rpl_requested_for_a_flush` in
#    `rpl_replica.cc:queue_event`.
# 2) Execute some statements in the master.
# 3) Retrieve the number of the relay log file with the highest index number.
# 4) Make the `FLUSH RELAY LOG` execution path to emit
#    `signal.rpl_requested_for_a_flush` right before waiting on the transaction
#    to end - in `rpl_info.cc:Rpl_info::request_rotate`.
# 5) Execute `FLUSH RELAY LOG` in the slave.
# 6) Add a debug sync point that holds the test execution and waits for the
#    flush to terminate - `signal.rpl_broadcasted_rotate_end`.
# 7) Make the applier execution path to emit `signal.rpl_broadcasted_rotate_end`
#    just after finishing processing the deferred flushing of the relay log - in
#    `rpl_info.cc:Rpl_info::clear_rotate_requests`.
# 8) Retrieve the number of the relay log file with the highest index number and
#    assert that the highest index number before the `FLUSH RELAY LOG` execution
#    is lower than the highest index number after.
# 9) Assert that the statements that blocked the relay log rotation are not in
#    the new relay log.
# 10) Ensure that all statements were executed on the slave.
