# Test to check if the flush command works fine for Group Replication.
#
# Test:
# 0. The test requires two servers: M1 and M2.
# 1. Setup a GROUP with two members ONLINE.
# 2. Test 'flush error logs' statement on M1. It should support.
# 3. Test 'flush relay logs' statement on M1. It should support.
# 4. Test 'flush slow logs' statement on M1. It should support.
# 5. Test 'flush general logs' statement on M1. It should support.
# 6. Test 'flush engine logs' statement on M1. It should support.
# For each 'flush..' command above:-
#  - Check error log file exists on M1.
#  - Make sure binary logs was not flushed on M1.
#  - Make sure applier logs was not flushed on M1.
#  - Make sure recovery logs was not flushed on M2.
#  - Make sure applier logs was not flushed on M2.
#  - Make sure binary logs was not flushed on M2.
#  - Test that replication is working fine between the members.
# 7. Test 'flush binary logs' statement on M1. It should support.
#  - Make sure binary logs is flushed on M1.
#  - Make sure that the 'show binary logs' statement shows the correct data.
#  - Make sure applier logs was not flushed on M1.
#  - Make sure recovery logs was not flushed on M2.
#  - Make sure applier logs was not flushed on M2.
#  - Make sure binary logs was not flushed on M2.
#  - Test that replication is working fine between the members.
# 8. Test if support to combine all kinds of logs into one statement on M1. It
#    should support 'flush error logs, relay logs'.
#  - Make sure binary logs was not flushed on M1.
#  - Make sure applier logs was not flushed on M1.
#  - Make sure recovery logs was not flushed on M2.
#  - Make sure applier logs was not flushed on M2.
#  - Make sure binary logs was not flushed on M2.
#  - Test that replication is working fine between the members.
# 9. Test if 'flush logs' statement works fine and flush all the logs on M1.
#  - Make sure binary logs is flushed on M1.
#  - Make sure applier logs was not flushed on M1.
#  - Make sure recovery logs was not flushed on M2.
#  - Make sure applier logs was not flushed on M2.
#  - Make sure binary logs was not flushed on M2.
#  - Execute 'flush logs' on M2:
#  - Make sure binary logs is flushed on M2.
#  - Make sure applier logs was not flushed on M2.
#  - Make sure applier logs was not flushed on M1.
#  - Make sure binary logs was not flushed on M1.
#  - Test that replication is working fine between the members.
