# WL#9053 : Group Replication: Push Group Replication Plugin to mysql-trunk
#
# This test does the basic check of prepared statements in
# group replication environment
#
# 0. This test requires two servers
# 1. Start Group Replication on two servers
# 2. Execute the following prepared statements on the members of the group
#  a) "CREATE TABLE.."
#  b) "INSERT.."
#  c) "SELECT.."
#  d) "UPDATE.."
#  e) "DELETE.."
#  f) "DROP.."
# 3. Verify the consistency of data across the group
# 4. Clean-up
