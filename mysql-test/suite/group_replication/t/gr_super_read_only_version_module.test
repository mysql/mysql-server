# This test verifies that when a server with higher major version tries to
# join the group, its compatibility type is set to READ_COMPATIBLE. As such
# that node can only be a part of the group in READ ONLY mode and cannot
# execute any writes.
#
# Test:
# 0. The test requires three servers: M1, M2 and M3.
# 1. Bootstrap start a group on M1. Start GR on M2. Check both are running.
# 2. Set DEBUG point in M3 to ensure that the major version of that node is
#    higher than that of the group.
#  - Start GR on M3. It should be able to join the group but in read only mode.
#  - Try executing DDL (create table) on M3. It must fail.
# 3. Stop GR on M3. The server's super_read_only mode should be 0 now.
#  - Try executing DDL (create table) on M3. It must succeed.
# 4. Clean up.
