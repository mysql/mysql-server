# Validate the behaviour of Group Replication stage events.
#
# Test:
# 01. GR Stage events are present when GR is running.
# 02. GR Stage events are cleaned on STOP GR.
# 03. Create some data on server1.
#     Recovery channel will have some data on server2.
# 04. Start GR on server2 and block it in recovery.
#     Applier is suspended while recovery is executing.
#     Stage events are updated.
# 05. Lock table t1 to block recovery during state transfer.
#     Applier is suspended while recovery is transferring state.
#     Stage events are updated.
# 06. Block recovery before it terminates.
#     Applier is executing while recovery is cleaning stage events.
# 07. Wait for server2 to be ONLINE.
#     Applier is executing while recovery data from tables is cleaned.
# 08. Cleanup.
