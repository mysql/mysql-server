# In the unlikely case a member receives a message that it does not knows,
# that member will leave the group/abort
#
# Test:
#   0. The test need two servers. They start in multi primary mode
#   1. Start the group making server 2 have a debug point to fail
#   2. Execute an action to change group to single primary mode on server 1
#      Server 2 shall leave the group and enable its read mode.
#   3. Restart group replication on server 2
#   4. Change the exit action to Abort
#      Execute an action to change group to multi primary mode on server 1
#      Server 2 shall abort.
#   5. Cleanup
