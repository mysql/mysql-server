# This test evaluates that group replication will fail when the applier fails
# applying events on start.
#
# The test guide is:
# 0. A two member group with started plugins
# 1. Create a table t1 on server 1 and replicate
# 2. Insert a row on server 2 with log to the binlog disabled
# 3. Write the same query in server 1
#    On server 2 the duplicated key will make the applier fail.
#    Server 2 will leave
# 4. Stop server 2 and start it again. One of three things can happen:
#  A. The applier fails after the join and the member leaves the group
#     but the START GROUP_REPLICATION command does not fail
#  B. The applier fails after initialization and sets the state to ERROR,
#     making the group join fail that makes the START GROUP_REPLICATION
#     command fail with a generic ER_GROUP_REPLICATION_CONFIGURATION.
#  C. The applier fails and its initialization processes catches the error.
#     During the start, it is known that the applier failed so the START
#     GROUP_REPLICATION fails with error ER_GROUP_REPLICATION_APPLIER_INIT_ERROR
# 5. Verify that member is offline after stop
# 6. Clean up
