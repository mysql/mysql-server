# Test cases for full-text search with the hypergraph optimizer
# (WL#14422). FTS with the hypergraph optimizer is also tested by the
# other tests in this suite. This test adds coverage for cases of
# particular interest for the hypergraph optimizer, which are not
# covered by the other tests.

# Some of the queries give different (wrong) results when running with
# the old optimizer, so this test only runs with the hypergraph
# optimizer enabled.
