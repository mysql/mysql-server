# FTS index with transaction
# Important Note:
# 1) Uncommitted records are not visible using FTS index - this is by FTS design
# 2) records will be seen using FTS index ONLY when transaction completes 
# 3) UNCOMMITTED RECORDS CAN BE SEEN WITH QURIES WHICH DO NOT USE FTS INDEX
# this behavior do not break integratity of tables and "select" which do not use FTS still can view them.
