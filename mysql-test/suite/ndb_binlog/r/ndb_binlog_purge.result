Test binlog purging, especially 'automatic' purging
Test binlog-expire-logs-seconds handling as part of normal
operation. Logs are rotated as part of transaction COMMIT (to
avoid a transaction being split across 2 files), rotation
checks binlog-expire-logs-seconds to decide whether to purge,
and purging calls into the Ndb handler to think about
deleting rows from ndb_binlog_index.
The delete from ndb_binlog_index is itself a SQL statement
executing *during* the COMMIT of some other transaction,
potentially in some other engine.  Don't want to think
about that too closely
show variables like 'log_bin';

call go_forth_and_make_binlog(40);
Now test binlog expiration at startup...
Disable the 'immediate expiration' mechanism
set global debug='';
Create some binlogs...
call go_forth_and_make_binlog(40);
Now restart, should re-pickup the expire-log-days
debug setting from the config file, and perform
expire-logs action at restart...
# restart
drop procedure go_forth_and_make_binlog;
drop table tm;
drop table tn;
