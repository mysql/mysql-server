Disconnect mysqld from all datanodes

Check that the binlog was rotated:
There should be a 'LOST EVENT', then 'Rotate ... binlog.000002'

Testcase1 for Bug#22494024 Slow binlog-setup -> MDL deadlock (Meta Data Lock)
ndb_binlog_setup() fails to fully complete and does not clean up
its partial setup binlog subscriptions on exit
=============================================================================
Prepare mysqld 'server2' to not entirely complete binlog_setup
Disconnect both mysqld servers from all datanodes -> binlog restarts
Wait for 'server1' binlog rotate to indicate disconnect
Wait for 'server2' binlog rotate to indicate disconnect
Wait for 'server1' to complete setup and get out of read-only mode
Give 'server2' some time to start, and fail, a binlog_setup
Create table operation on 'server1' grab MDL lock while waiting for
schema change distribution to all subscribing mysqld.
create table t1 (a int primary key) engine=ndb;
drop table t1;
Wait for 'server2' to complete setup and get out of read-only mode

Testcase2 for Bug#22494024 Slow binlog-setup -> MDL deadlock (Meta Data Lock)
Table 'ndb_schema' is accessed from a SQL query. Causing it to be opened
and a SUBSCRIBE-event sent to other mysqld.
=============================================================================
Prepare mysqld 'server2' to do slow binlog_setup upon restart
Disconnect both mysqld servers from all datanodes -> binlog restarts
Wait for 'server1' binlog rotate to indicate disconnect
Wait for 'server2' binlog rotate to indicate disconnect
Wait for (fast) 'server1' to complete setup and get out of read-only mode
Create table operation on 'server1' grab MDL lock while waiting for
schema distribution to all subscribing mysqld -> stuck on 'server2'
create table t1 (a int primary key) engine=ndb;
