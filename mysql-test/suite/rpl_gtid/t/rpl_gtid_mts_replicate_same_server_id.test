# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that --replicate-same-server-id works with GTID_MODE=ON and
# MTS.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# The main implementation is in the .opt file: it sets up master and
# slave with MTS enabled and with replicate-same-server-id enabled.
# The test case just checks that it works to replicate a couple of
# simple statements in this scenario. This test does not actually use
# the same server_id on master and slave.

# BUG#18967791 SLAVE THREAD FAILS WITH MTS + GTID + REPLICATE_SAME_SERVER_ID
#   Prior to this bug, the MTS slave would fail when reading
#   Previous_gtids_log_event.  This only happened when
#   replicate-same-server-id was enabled because any
#   Previous_gtids_log_event in the relay log is generated by the
#   slave and has the slave's server_id.
