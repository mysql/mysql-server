# Bug#20464737 SEMI_SYNC: SLAVE IO FAILS WITH ER1236 'SLAVE HAS MORE GTIDS THAN
#              THE MASTER HAS'
#
# Slaves, especially semisync slaves, encountered ER1236 when connecting to
# their masters. When connecting to the master with COM_GTID_DUMP request,
# the slave sends all replicated gtids to master and master checks if all the
# slave gtids(only the gtids have master's uuid) are included in master's
# gtid_executed. However, there is a chance that a gtid is already in slave's
# gtid_executed, but not in master's gtid_executed. Gtid is added into
# gtid_executed after it is binlogged, so it is possible that a transaction is
# replicated and applied on slave, but not committed on master yet.
#
# To fix it, master will check if all gtids are in the set of (gtid_executed,
# owned_gtids).
