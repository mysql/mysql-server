# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test verifies that forced sync master info doesn't happen on a
# heartbeat/fakerotate event.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Generate some transactions on master so that they are replicated and applied
# on slave. This will ensure that GITD_EXECUTED set is updated on slave.
#
# Stop and restart the slave. Receiver thread will invoke 'com_binlog_dump_gtid'
# function call which provides existing GTID specific information on slave to
# master.
#
# Master will skip all the GTID events that are present on slave and will
# generate a HEARTBEAT event which contains the Source_Log_File and
# source_log_pos at which the skipped events end.
#
# Upon receiving the HEARTBEAT event store the write requests that are made to
# 'slave_master_info' table, in a variable. This value is used to verify the
# write request to 'slave_master_info' after the HEARTBEAT event is processed.
#
# Apply the HEARTBEAT event and verify that no additional write request is
# made during HEARTBEAT event processing.
