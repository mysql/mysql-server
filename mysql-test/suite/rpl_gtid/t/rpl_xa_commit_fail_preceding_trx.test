# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verify that XA COMMIT handles commit errors correctly. In particular, this
# checks the case that a replicated XA COMMIT waits on the preceding
# transaction to commit, and then the preceding transaction fails.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# R1. If a replicated XA COMMIT is waiting for the preceding transaction to commit,
#     and then the preceding transaction fails,
#     then the XA COMMIT should fail, leave the XA transaction in prepared state,
#     release ownership of its GTID, leave the table unchanged, not update
#     gtid_executed, not write the binary log, and fail any following transaction
#     that is waiting to commit after XA COMMIT.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# - Execute transactions T1, T2, and T3 in parallel on source. T2 is XA COMMIT.
#   But before that:
#   - On the replica, commit a transaction that will conflict with T1,
#     so that T1 will fail when it executes.
#   - On the replica, begin a transaction that will block T1 from
#     executing, allowing T2 and T3 to execute first, so that T2 and T3 both
#     reach the state where they wait for the preceding transaction to commit.
# - As soon as both T2 and T3 have reached the state where they wait for the
#   preceding transaction to commit, rollback the transaction that blocks T1
#   from executing.
# - Now T1 will reach the error condition. It fails, and then signals
#   T2 to fail. T2 then rolls back and signals T3 to fail. T3 rolls back.
#   Eventually all the applier threads stop.
# - Verify that the requirements hold.
#
# In order to make T1, T2, and T3 execute in parallel on the replica, they
# have to commit together on the source. To enforce that, we use a debug
# sync point that makes T1 wait just after it has become the leader of BGC.
# Then we execute T2 up to the same point, which makes it the second member
# of the same commit group. Then we execute T3 up to the same point, which
# makes it the third member of the same group. Then we release all there
# threads, which deterministically makes T1, as the leader of the group,
# perform the full commit, and generate commit timestamps that make the
# transactions parallelizable on the replica.
