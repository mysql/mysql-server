# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This script tests server behavior when a crash occurs while applying an
# of `XA COMMIT`, on the replica, and after binary log has been rotated (`XA
# PREPARED` is no longer in the latest binary log file).
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# Pre-conditions:
# PC1. Asynchronous replication topology with 2 servers (source -> replica).
# PC2. GTID is enabled.
#
# After server restart:
# R1. The `XA PREPARE` statement shouldn't be found in the replca's binlog.
# R2. The `XA COMMIT` statement shouldn't be found in the replca's binlog.
# R3. There shouldn't be any changes to GTID_EXECUTED, on the replica.
# R4. There should be one pending XA transactions visible with `XA
#     RECOVER`, on the replica.
# R5. There should still be one pending XA transaction visible with `XA
#     RECOVER`, on the replica, if server is restarted after the
#     crash-recovery.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Setup scenario: create table and insert some records on the source.
# 2. Start and execute, on the source, an XA transaction containing an
#    insert until before `XA COMMIT`.
# 3. Take the `GTID_EXECUTED` state on the replica.
# 4. Rotate and purge the replica's binary logs.
# 5. Crash the replica during `XA COMMIT` execution, before commiting in the
#    TC.
# 6. Restart the replica server and check it for:
#    a. Error log for messages stating that recovery process found one
#       transaction needing recovery.
#    b. The `XA PREPARE` and `XA COMMIT` aren't found in the replica's
#       binary log.
#    c. The GTID_EXECUTED variable wasn't updated.
#    d. There is one pending XA transaction listed in the output of `XA
#       RECOVER`.
#    e. There aren't changes to the table.
# 7. Restart the replica and check that the transaction is still in preared
#    state, meaning, the recovery process moved the transaction to
#    `PERSISTED_IN_TC` and that state was persisted.
# 8. Start replica.
# 9. Check the table has changed.
