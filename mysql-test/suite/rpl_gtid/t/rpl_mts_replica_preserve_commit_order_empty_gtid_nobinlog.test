# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verifies that replica-preserve-commit-order preserves the commit order
# for empty gtid transaction.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. We start replica (server2) with the binary log turned off (--log-bin=OFF)
#    and applier threads are not logging to its own binary log
#    (--log-replica-updates=OFF). Replica also has replica_preserve_commit_order
#    enabled and running with 2 applier workers.
#
# 2. On slave, we block empty transaction by initializing
#    syncpoint_commit_order_manager_after_wait_100 debug macro which blocks
#    transaction with timestamp 100.
#
# 3. The master then adds empty transaction, which gets blocked due to
#    initalized debug macro in step 2. Few more inserts are added on master with
#    same commit parents so that they can be applied in parallel on slave.
#
# 4. On slave, we verify that all the other inserts are also blocked and waiting
#    for first empty transaction to commit i.e. applier threads are in stage
#    'Waiting for preceding transaction to commit' and their is no data in the
#    table.
#
# 5. On slave, we signal the syncpoint_commit_order_manager_after_wait_100 debug
#    macro to unblock and verify the transactions applied in step 3 are applied
#    successfully.
#
# 6. Cleanup.
