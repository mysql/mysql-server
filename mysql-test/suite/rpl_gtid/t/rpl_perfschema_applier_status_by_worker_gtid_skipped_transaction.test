#
# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test asserts that the table performance_schema.replication_applier_status_by_worker
# does not display information about a GTID-skipped transaction.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# The test starts by replicating some transactions on the slave.
# Then, it forces the slave to skip a transaction originated in the master.
# Finally, it checks that the skippped transaction information is not present
# in table performance_schema.replication_applier_status_by_worker.
