# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Verifies that replica-preserve-commit-order preserves the commit order with
# slave binlog enabled for OPTIMIZE TABLE query even for those cases
# where applier worker threads are not logging the changes to the
# replicas binary log.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. We start replica (server2) with the binary log turned off (--log-bin=OFF)
#    and applier threads are not logging to its own binary log
#    (--log-replica-updates=OFF). Replica also has replica_preserve_commit_order
#    enabled and running with 2 applier workers.
#
# 2. On slave, we add the same first insert statement which will be applied on
#    master in step 3, but we do not commit it, to take a lock on row and block
#    slave sql thread when transaction are applied on master in setp 3.
#
# 3. The master generates some transactions which can be applied in parallel,
#    which also include OPTIMIZE TABLE query, by setting same commit parents
#    for all the inserts.
#
# 4. On slave, we verify that all the other inserts are also blocked and waiting
#    for first insert to commit i.e. applier threads are in stage 'Waiting for
#    preceding transaction to commit' and their is no data in table except first
#    insert.
#
# 5. On slave, we rollback the insert executed in step 2, and verify the
#    transactions applied in step 3 are applied successfully.
#
# 6. Cleanup.
