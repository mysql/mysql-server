# ==== Purpose ====
#
# When the slave SQL thread processes transactions, it internally keeps
# track of the starting position of the current transaction. This position
# is used to rewind the position in case the SQL thread is stopped in the
# middle of a transaction, or in case the transaction is re-executed due to
# replica_transaction_retries > 0.
#
# This test verifies that the start of the transaction is correctly updated
# even if the transaction spans multiple relay logs, such that a Gtid_log_event
# is immediately followed by a Rotate_log_event.

--echo # Preparing the relaylog
#
# Create a relaylog on slave containing a relaylog file that finishes with
# an Gtig_log_event and the rest of the group (transaction) is in the
# next relaylog file.
#
# The better way of doing this is disabling slave's auto positioning
# and using a debug point to stop the IO thread right after queuing
# the Gtid_log_event. Because auto positioning is disabled, the IO thread
# will not ask the Gtid_log_event again.
