# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test will verify if the IO thread will correctly handle the GTID and
# the transaction boundary of transactions spanned along multiple relay log
# files.
#
# This test starts creating a single transaction (CREATE TABLE), and then
# sets a debug point that will make the IO thread to stop after queuing an
# QUERY_LOG_EVENT. The test will stop the SQL thread after syncing with the
# master.
#
# The test will then apply a transaction composed by three INSERT statements
# that will be logged on master as one GTID_LOG_EVENT, four QUERY_LOG_EVENTS
# (the BEGIN plus the three INSERT) and a XID_LOG_EVENT.
#
# By disabling GTID auto positioning, and restating the IO thread after each
# time it stops because of the debug point, we guarantee that GTID+BEGIN will
# be in one relay log file, each INSERT will be alone in distinct relay log
# files and the XID will finalize the transaction in another relay log file.
#
# Finally, the test will restart the MySQL slave server to make it recover the
# Retrieved_Gtid_Set from the relay log with the spanned transaction.
