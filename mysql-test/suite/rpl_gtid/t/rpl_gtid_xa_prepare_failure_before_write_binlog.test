# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This script tests server behavior when a crash occurs while applying an
# `XA PREPARE` and just before the transaction is written to the replica's
# binary log.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# Pre-conditions:
# PC1. Asynchronous replication topology with 2 servers (source -> replica).
# PC2. GTID is enabled.
#
# After server restart:
# R1. The `XA PREPARE` statement shouldn't be logged to the replica's binlog.
# R2. There shouldn't be any changes to GTID_EXECUTED, on the replica.
# R3. There shouldn't be any pending XA transactions visible with `XA
#     RECOVER`, on the replica.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# 1. Setup scenario: create table and insert some records on the source.
# 2. Start and execute, on the source, an XA transaction containing an
#    insert until before `XA PREPARE`.
# 3. Take the `GTID_EXECUTED` state on the replica.
# 4. Crash the replica during `XA PREPARE` execution, after preparing in
#    the storage engines and just before writing to the binary log.
# 5. Restart the replica server and check it for:
#    a. Error log for messages stating that recovery process found one
#       transaction needing recovery.
#    b. The `XA PREPARE` wasn't logged to the replica's binary log.
#    c. There aren't any changes to GTID_EXECUTED.
#    d. There aren't any pending XA transaction listed in the output of `XA
#       RECOVER`.
#    e. There aren't changes to the table.
# 6. Start replica.
# 7. Check that the `XA PREPARE` was properly replicated back, after
#    replica catches up with the source.
# 8. Commit the transaction on the source.
# 9. Check that the replica successfully applied the transaction.
