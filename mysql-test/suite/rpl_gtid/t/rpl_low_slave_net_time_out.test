# Bug #19975697 SLAVE IO_THREAD MAY GET STUCK WHEN USING GTID AND LOW
# REPLICA_NET_TIMEOUTS
#
# Problem: Dump thread is not checking the necessity of heartbeat event
#  while it is scanning through the binary log files and skipping some groups
#  which were already present at Slave.
# Fix: Dump thread will check whether it is time to send an heartbeat event or
#  not before skipping an event. If so, it will send one to Slave.

# Now Dump thread-I/O thread communitcation protocol will detect that

# should send that transaction to Slave. This detection will take
# 12 seconds because of the injected 2 seconds delay after every skipped
# event (Please see above) which is more than the replica_net_timeout.
# But now, after the fix, the server will check for necessity of sending an
# heartbeat event even while it is skipping the events, the below
# sync should not be timed out after the fix.
