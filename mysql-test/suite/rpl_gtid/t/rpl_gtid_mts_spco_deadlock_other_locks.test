# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test's goal is to check that no deadlock occurs in an SPCO enabled
# multi-threaded replica when client connections issue global locking or
# ACL statements concurrently with the applier worker threads.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
#
# R1. A multi-threaded applier with enabled commit order preservation MUST
#     be able to break deadlocks mixing commit order serialization and
#     global locks like the ones taken by `SET READ_ONLY = ON` or `FLUSH
#     TABLES WITH READ LOCK`.
#
# R2. A multi-threaded applier with enabled commit order preservation MUST
#     be able to break deadlocks mixing commit order serialization and ACL
#     related locks.
#
# R3. A multi-threaded applier with enabled commit order preservation MUST
#     keep the current retry behavior by enforcing the
#     `replica_transaction_retries` variable value for the amount of retries,
#     when requested to back-off a transaction deadlocked by _R1_ and _R2_
#     described scenarios.
#
# R4. A multi-threaded applier with enabled commit order preservation MUST
#     keep the current replication channel behavior by stopping both the
#     coordinator and worker threads when the configured amount of
#     transaction retries is reached unsuccessfully, when requested to
#     back-off a transaction deadlocked by _R1_ and _R2_ described
#     scenarios.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# Setup
# -----
#   1. Create two tables on the source
#   2. Setup replica to be multi-threaded
#
# Scenario logic
# --------------
# The scenarios being tested are all built upon a generic logic that will
# serliaze the client side execution and the MTA worker thread in order to
# force a deadlock situation that should be broken. This logic is
# implemented in `extra/rpl_tests/mts_spco_generate_deadlock.inc` and the file
# contains a description on how it's done. A high-level description is:
#
#   1. On the source, set up a commit group that contains statements that
#      shouldn't be paralellized together using DBUG sync points.
#   2. On the replica, using client connection A, start a transaction and
#      assign it the same GTID as the first statement issued on the source.
#   3. On the replica, using an additional client connection, issue a
#      statement that will introduce a circular locking dependency with the
#      worker threads and their assigned statements.
#   4. Wait until all worker threads and client connections are waiting on
#      each other.
#   5. On the replica, rollback the transaction started in 2., leading to
#      the locking circularity to be complete.
#   6. Wait for the replica to error out or to overcome the deadlock,
#      depending on the configuration. In this test-case, the replica
#      should error out.
#   7. Revert the effects of 3., breaking the deadlock and restart
#      replication.
#
#   Also, each test case is repeated twice: once where worker threads are
#   all made to wait on the commit order queue and all are required to
#   back-off by the MDL infra-structure; once where the worker executing
#   the last transaction on the commit order is made to wait before
#   arriving the commit stage and until the deadlock is identified, in
#   which case this last worker will be required to back-off by the state
#   of the commit order queue.
#
# TC1. `GLOBAL READ_ONLY=ON` issued by client and DDL replicated from source.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   1. Alter a table and insert rows on the source in a way that they will
#      belong to the same commit group.
#   2. On the replica, using client connection B, execute `SET GLOBAL
#      READ_ONLY=ON` to acquire the global read lock, leading to the
#      following lock acquisition dependencies: Client B --commit lock-->
#      Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1 --gtid lock--> Client A.
#   3. On the replica, using client conneciton A, rollback the pending
#      transaction, leading to the following lock acquisition dependencies:
#      Client B --commit lock--> Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1
#      --global read lock--> Client B.
#   4. Wait for the replication applier to error out with
#      ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK or ER_REPLICA_WORKER_STOPPED_PREVIOUS_THD_ERROR.
#   5. On the replica, using client connection B, execute `SET GLOBAL
#      READ_ONLY=OFF` to let the applier worker threads to finish after
#      restart of the applier.
#
# TC2. `GLOBAL READ_ONLY=ON` issued by client and DML replicated from source.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   1. Insert rows on the source in a way that they will belong to the same
#      commit group.
#   2. On the replica, using client connection B, execute `SET GLOBAL
#      READ_ONLY=ON` to acquire the global read lock, leading to the
#      following lock acquisition dependencies: Client B --commit lock-->
#      Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1 --gtid lock--> Client A.
#   3. On the replica, using client conneciton A, rollback the pending
#      transaction, leading to the following lock acquisition dependencies:
#      Client B --commit lock--> Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1
#      --global read lock--> Client B.
#   4. Wait for the replication applier to error out with
#      ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK or ER_REPLICA_WORKER_STOPPED_PREVIOUS_THD_ERROR.
#   5. On the replica, using client connection B, execute `SET GLOBAL
#      READ_ONLY=OFF` to let the applier worker threads to finish.
#
# TC3. `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` issued by client and DDL replicated
#      from source.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   1. Alter a table and insert rows on the source in a way that they will
#      belong to the same commit group.
#   2. On the replica, using client connection B, execute `FLUSH TABLES
#      WITH READ LOCK` to acquire the global read lock, leading to the
#      following lock acquisition dependencies: Client B --commit lock-->
#      Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1 --gtid lock--> Client A.
#   3. On the replica, using client conneciton A, rollback the pending
#      transaction, leading to the following lock acquisition dependencies:
#      Client B --commit lock--> Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1
#      --global read lock--> Client B.
#   4. Wait for the replication applier to error out with
#      ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK or ER_REPLICA_WORKER_STOPPED_PREVIOUS_THD_ERROR.
#   5. On the replica, using client connection B, execute `UNLOCK TABLES`
#      to let the applier worker threads to finish.
#
# TC4. `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` issued by client and DML replicated
#      from source.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   1. Insert rows on the source in a way that they will belong to the same
#      commit group.
#   2. On the replica, using client connection B, execute `SET GLOBAL
#      READ_ONLY=ON` to acquire the global read lock, leading to the
#      following lock acquisition dependencies: Client B --commit lock-->
#      Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1 --gtid lock--> Client A.
#   3. On the replica, using client conneciton A, rollback the pending
#      transaction, leading to the following lock acquisition dependencies:
#      Client B --commit lock--> Worker 2 --commit order lock--> Worker 1
#      --global read lock--> Client B.
#   4. Wait for the replication applier to error out with
#      ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK or ER_REPLICA_WORKER_STOPPED_PREVIOUS_THD_ERROR.
#   5. On the replica, using client connection B, execute `UNLOCK TABLES`
#      to let the applier worker threads to finish.
#
# TC5. DML issued by client and `XA PREPARE` replicated from source.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   1. Insert row on the source withing an XA transaction and issue `XA
#      PREPARE` in a way that they will belong to the same commit group.
#   2. On the replica, using client conneciton A, rollback the pending
#      transaction, leading to the following lock acquisition dependencies:
#      Worker 1 --data lock--> Client B.
#   3. Wait for the replica applier to error out with ER_LOCK_WAIT_TIMEOUT.
#   4. On the source, issue `XA COMMIT` to allow the applier worker threads
#      to finish.
