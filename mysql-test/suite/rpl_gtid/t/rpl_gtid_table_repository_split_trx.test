# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test case will verify that applier works correctly (writing the slave
# rpl info on table and also storing GTIDs on table) when a relay log split
# a transaction letting the GTID event in one relay log file and the rest of
# the transaction on the next relay log file. The reported issue happened when
# log-replica-updates was off and relay-log-info-repository was set to TABLE,
# both defined at test case '-slave.opt' file.
#
# The test case will generate a stream of events with two "transactions" and
# will flush the slave relay log once queuing the second GTID event received.
#
# After syncing the receiver thread, the test case will start the applier
# thread to ensure its proper behavior.
