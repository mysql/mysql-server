#
# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test ensures that a fully retrieved transaction will not be asked to be
# retrieved again by the IO thread.
#
# The test first creates a transactional table and add some data on it. Then,
# it issues a "RESET MASTER" on the slave to make the slave to clean its
# GTID_EXECUTED, but the Retrieved_Gtid_Set is kept untouched.
# A restart in the IO thread with this situation should not make the IO thread
# to retrieve the last received transaction again. The test case test this by
# verifying the table consistency after syncing the slave SQL thread.
