#
# The test verifies expected behaviour when
# the slave retries events starting from group internal position.
# Their execution in Logical_Clock mode is allowed.
# See bug#19473291.
# Notice that old master events are viewed effectively as
# malformed group events. Therefore this test applies to cross-version replication
# as well.
#
# GTIDs are expected in binlog when events are indexed by query_get_value below

# Logic of the test is as the following.
# Configure MTS with few workers and LOGICAL_CLOCK scheduler.
# Replicate some events.
# Stop replica threads to reconfigure retrival from an already read, executed and
# group internal position (COMMIT/Xid event position is chosen to avoid
# a GTID specific error).
# Restart replica threads and observe the SQL applier has processed events.
