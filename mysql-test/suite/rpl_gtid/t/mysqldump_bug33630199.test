# ===== Purpose =====
#
# 1) The purpose of this test is to check if the GTIDs, and the data dumped
#    by mysqldump are consistent. Especially the case when the server has
#    GTIDs enabled, and there are transactions running in the background,
#    during the dump.
# 2) We've to also make sure that the dump file can be restored on a
#    GTID aware server.
#
# ===== Implementation =====
#
# Consists of 2 steps
#
# - Step 1 -
# 1) Create a test table 't', in database 'db'
# 2) Create a stored procedure, which will be called just before mysqldump
#    is executed. This will help us to mimick a scenario in which there are
#    transactions going on in the background, while mysqldump is dumping
#    the databases.
# 3) Call the procedure, then start mysqldump just after that
#
# - Step 2 -
# 5) Now restore the dump file to the slave
# 6) Execute some statements on the master
# 7) Sync master, and slave
# 8) The slave's GTID_EXECUTED must be equal to the master's one
#
# ===== Requirements =====
#
# 1) The dump captured by mysqldump with --single-transaction and
#	 set-gtid-purged=ON must contain the exact set of transaction GTIDs
#	 that were extracted.
# 2) The dump file can be restored without any issue
# 3) The replication is working fine
# 4) The slave's GTID_EXECUTED must be equal to the master's one
#    when replication catches up.
