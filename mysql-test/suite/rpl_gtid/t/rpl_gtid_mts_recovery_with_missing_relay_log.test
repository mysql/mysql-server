# === Purpose ===
#
# This test verifies that MTS crash recovery succeeds with GTID Auto Position=ON
# and --relay-log-recovery=ON irrespective of repository type when relay logs
# that are required to fill the gaps are missing.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# If GTID_MODE = ON and SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION = 1 :
#
# R1: Verify that execution gaps on the relay log when using the multi threaded
#     applier don't affect replica restarts when --relay-log-recovery=ON or OFF
#
# R2: Even if gaps exist, using  START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS will throw
#     an warning stating that gaps were not calculated.
#
# === Implementation ====
#
# 0. Create helper files for restarting the server with gaps
# 1. Check the replica can start after a restart that leaves gaps on the relay log
#    and relay log recovery is not used
# 2. Check the replica can start after a restart that leaves gaps on the relay log
#    and relay log recovery is used
# 3. Check the replica can't start after a restart that leaves gaps on the relay log
#    if GTID_MODE != ON even with relay log recovery
# 4. Even if gaps exist, using  START SLAVE UNTIL SQL_AFTER_MTS_GAPS will throw
#    an warning stating that gaps were not calculated.
# 5. Cleanup
