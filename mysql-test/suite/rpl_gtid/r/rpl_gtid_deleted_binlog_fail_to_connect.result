Warnings:
Note	####	Sending passwords in plain text without SSL/TLS is extremely insecure.
Note	####	Storing MySQL user name or password information in the master info repository is not secure and is therefore not recommended. Please consider using the USER and PASSWORD connection options for START SLAVE; see the 'START SLAVE Syntax' in the MySQL Manual for more information.

# 2) Create a table on master, sync it, stop the slave threads and dump
#    thread on master.

# 3) On master, generate a transaction, flush the binary log and delete
#    the first binary logs so that only remaining binlog only contains
#    transaction UUID:3.

INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1);
FLUSH LOGS;
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (2);

# 4) Verify that the slave fails if it tries to connect using CHANGE
#    MASTER TO MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1.
