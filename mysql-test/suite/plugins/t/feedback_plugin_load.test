# We cannot record the actual value, because the test can be executed more than once,
# but we can check that the value indeed increases as expected.
# There is still a room for some race condition, e.g. if at the very moment
# between first SELECT to store the value and the next SELECT to check that it increases,
# the feedback plugin is activated. But the probability of it is close to 0,
# so lets get back to it if it ever happens.

# Lets say the plugin was used X times before this SELECT
SELECT variable_value INTO @feedback_used FROM information_schema.feedback where variable_name = 'FEEDBACK used';

# Now $feedback_used == X+1, and 'FEEDBACK used' is also X+1. And variable_value is increased again when we run the next SELECT
SELECT variable_value = @feedback_used + 1 FROM information_schema.feedback where variable_name = 'FEEDBACK used';

# Now when we are happy with 'FEEDBACK used', we can check everything else
