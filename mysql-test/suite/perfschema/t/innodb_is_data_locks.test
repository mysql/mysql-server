#
# WARNING
# =======
#
# Spurious failures possible on column LOCK_DATA
#
# One one hand, for the innodb storage engine,
# the server returns the LOCK_DATA column using
# 'best effort', without guarantees.
# See in innodb:
# - Innodb_data_lock_iterator::scan_trx()
# - p_s_fill_lock_data()
# - buf_page_try_get()
#
# In short, if the page is in the buffer pool,
# LOCK_DATA for the record is returned.
# However, if the page is not in the buffer pool,
# the code just returns LOCK_DATA = NULL
# instead of re-loading the page from disk just
# to read LOCK_DATA.
#
# On the other hand, the point of this test
# is to inspect LOCK_DATA returned in the
# performance schema, to make sure the proper
# record lock is printed.
#
# Note that a NULL is a valid result, not a failure.
#
# Due to connection con2 doing a select,
# the hope is that this test produces predictable results.

# Wait for con2 to block
