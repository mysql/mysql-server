# 0. The values within the columns "thread_id" and "processlist_id" depend
#    on server history. Therefore they are unstable and need to be omitted.
# 1. The columns "time" and "state" are omitted because it is thinkable that
#    they contain slightly unstable though correct values.
# 2. The unification of the column "parent_thread_id" is in the moment most
#    probably not required because I observed all time that the parent is
#    "thread/sql/main" with the thread_id = 1.
#    But there might be more kinds of parents with most probably unstable
#    "thread_id" values in future.
