# Tests for PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA

# Setup

update performance_schema.setup_instruments set enabled='NO';
update performance_schema.setup_instruments set enabled='YES'
  where name like "wait/io/file/myisam/%";

update performance_schema.setup_consumers
  set enabled='YES';

# Reset lost counters to a known state
flush status;

# Code to test

--disable_warnings
drop table if exists test.no_index_tab;

create table test.no_index_tab ( a varchar(255), b int ) engine=myisam;
insert into no_index_tab set a = 'foo', b = 1;
insert into no_index_tab set a = 'foo', b = 1;
insert into no_index_tab set a = 'foo', b = 1;

# Verification
# Note that mi_create.c contains mysql_file_tell() calls in debug only,
# so the result are filtered to remove 'tell'.
# Note that even after setting other instruments to enabled='NO'
# and truncating the events_waits_history_long table,
# some events -- that were already started but not completed --
# for other instruments could still be added in the history.
# To protect against that, an extra where clause
# "and event_name like "wait/io/file/myisam/%"
# is added to the select to filter out the result.

select event_name,
  left(source, locate(":", source)) as short_source,
  operation, number_of_bytes,
  substring(object_name, locate("no_index_tab", object_name)) as short_name
  from performance_schema.events_waits_history_long
  where operation not like "tell"
  and event_name like "wait/io/file/myisam/%"
