# There are several InnoDB io_handler_threads servicing for read IO, write IO etc.
# The number of these threads is at least for some types configurable.
# We suppress here duplicates rows with the goal to avoid that the test fails
# in case some defaults are changed.
# Also 'thread/innodb/trx_recovery_rollback_thread' is disabled explicitly
# because it's a short life thread which results in result mismatch sporadically
