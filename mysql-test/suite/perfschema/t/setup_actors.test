#   run a select on INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST for the corresponding thread.
# Check at least once that this is fulfilled.
# Note(mleich):
#   A join between INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST and performance_schema.threads
#   Example:
#      select count(*) = 1
#      from performance_schema.threads T inner join information_schema.PROCESSLIST P
#      on T.PROCESSLIST_ID = P.ID and T.PROCESSLIST_USER = P.USER and

#      where T.PROCESSLIST_ID = connection_id() and T.NAME = 'thread/sql/one_connection'
#   executed by the current connection looks like some of the most elegant solutions
#   for revealing this. But such a join suffers from sporadic differences like
#      column |  observation
#      -------|-------------
#      state  |  "Sending data" vs. "executing"
#      time   |  0 vs. 1 (high load on the testing box)
#      info   |  <full statement> vs. NULL (use of "--ps-protocol")
#   IMHO the differences are harmless.
#   Therefore we use here a different solution.
