# Note that in general:
# - COUNT/SUM/MAX(file_summary_by_event_name) >=
#   COUNT/SUM/MAX(file_summary_by_instance).
# - MIN(file_summary_by_event_name) <=
#   MIN(file_summary_by_instance).
# There will be equality only when file instances are not removed,
# aka when a file is not deleted from the file system,
# because doing so removes a row in file_summary_by_instance.

# Likewise:
# - COUNT/SUM/MAX(events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name) >=
#   COUNT/SUM/MAX(events_waits_summary_by_instance)
# - MIN(events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name) <=
#   MIN(events_waits_summary_by_instance)
# There will be equality only when an instrument instance
# is not removed, which is next to impossible to predictably guarantee
# in the server.
# For example, a MyISAM table removed from the table cache
# will cause a mysql_mutex_destroy on myisam/MYISAM_SHARE::intern_lock.
# Another example, a thread terminating will cause a mysql_mutex_destroy
# on sql/LOCK_delete
# Both cause a row to be deleted from events_waits_summary_by_instance.

# Likewise:
# - COUNT/SUM/MAX(events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name) >=
#   COUNT/SUM/MAX(events_waits_summary_by_thread_by_event_name)
# - MIN(events_waits_summary_global_by_event_name) <=
#   MIN(events_waits_summary_by_thread_by_event_name)
# There will be equality only when no thread is removed,
# that is if no thread disconnects, or no sub thread (for example insert
# delayed) ever completes.
# A thread completing will cause rows in
# events_waits_summary_by_thread_by_event_name to be removed.

# Since the code generating the load in this test does:
# - create table
# - insert
# - does not cause temporary tables to be used
# we can test for equality here for file aggregates.
