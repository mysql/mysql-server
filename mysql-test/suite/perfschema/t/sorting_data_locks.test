--echo # Bug #28176910
--echo # PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.DATA_LOCKS.OBJECT_INSTANCE_BEGIN
--echo # CHANGES DEPENDING ON ORDER

# This scenario is meant to create a situation in which a single
# transaction has two locks for the same record, which differ only
# in their mode (X vs X,REC_NOT_GAP) which historicaly caused a bug
# in that both of them had the same performance.data_locks.engine_lock_id.
# Having two rows with the same engline_lock_id caused visible problems:
# using SELECT...FROM data_locks ORDER BY ... caused one of the two rows
# to be reported twice and the other row not even once.
# There were also problems with data_lock_waits which should contain
# exactly one edge for each pair of conflicting locks, however having
# two rows with the same id in data_locks could lead to strange results
# when joining data_locks with data_lock_waits.
# Finally, the information_schema.innodb_trx.trx_requested_lock_id could
# be joined with performance_schema.data_locks.engine_lock_id again
# leading to strange results.
# This test checks that:
# - engline_lock_id values are unique
# - that ORDER BY does not lead to duplicates
# - that JOIN with data_lock_waits works correctly
# - that JOIN with innodb_trx works correctly
