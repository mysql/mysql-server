# Notes
#
# The point of this test is to make sure code is properly instrumented,
# where instruments have the proper key (binlog or relaylog),
# it is not to dive into statistics for each instruments.
# Different test execution sequence in different platforms do make the
# results vary, making the test results very sensitive to changes.
# To ensure robustness:
# - log file rotation is limited to file .000001 and .000002
# - statistics are normalized to "NONE" or "MANY"
# - statistics on ::update_cond conditions are not collected,
#   since this is too much dependent on execution.
