rpl_ndb_set_null       : bug #51100

# The below two tests runs extra/rpl_tests/rpl_mixed_implicit_commit_binlog
# which is maintained upstream and easily breaks due to the inherent
# difference in binlog ouput depending on who's creating the binlog.
# These tests should be merged and made much more stable by not having
# to hardcode "magic" numbers into the test. Test should also be fixed
# to switch binlog_format itself if that is necessary for the test to properly
# test everything.
