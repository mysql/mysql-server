# For most engines SHOW ENGINE .. STATUS produces an empty result,
# so the default result file is empty; but returning a value here is not an error.
# The Status column is masked, because it is likely to contain some
# volatile data (timestamps, memory info, etc.)
SHOW ENGINE <STORAGE_ENGINE> STATUS;
Type	Name	Status
<STORAGE_ENGINE>		### Engine status, can be long and changeable ###
# For SHOW MUTEX even the number of lines is volatile, so the result logging is disabled,
# the test only checks that the command does not produce any errors
SHOW ENGINE <STORAGE_ENGINE> MUTEX;
SHOW ENGINE ALL MUTEX;
