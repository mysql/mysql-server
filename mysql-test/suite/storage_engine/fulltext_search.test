  'There are several reasons why contributing code is one of the easiest and most rewarding ways to contribute to MariaDB:

     1. We are very responsive toward reviews of submitted code and as soon as the review is done, the submitted code is merged into an existing MariaDB tree and made available to everyone, not just select customers.
     2. Code reviews are performed by the MariaDB core development team and the quality, detail, and timeliness of our reviews are better than you will find elsewhere.
     3. With MariaDB everyone has access to the latest code.
     4. If a patch is very safe and/or very useful we are willing to push it into the stable code (as long as it can\'t break any existing applications). We are willing to do this to ensure the freedom to add small, needed fixes on a stable release so users don\'t have to wait a year for something to be added which is critical to their business.
     5. If you are an active contributor, you can become a member of maria-captains, even if you aren\'t working for Monty Program Ab. All captains have the same rights as any other captain to accept and reject patches. Our development model is truly open for everyone. 

  The Contributing Code page details many of the actual steps involved in working with the MariaDB source code. It\'s important that you use the same tools and submit patches in the same way as other developers to keep development running smoothly.'
