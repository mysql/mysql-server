Create a couple of tables to defeat Binlog Injector's
creation of multi-image events which can be batch-applied
on the slave regardless of replica_allow_batching
create table t1 (pk int primary key, a varchar(8000))
engine=ndb character set latin1;
create table t2 (pk int primary key, a varchar(8000))
engine=ndb character set latin1;
Insert some data which we can later delete
This also serves to 'prime' the Slave, so that NdbApi
access related to slave setup (last_replicated_epoch fetch etc)
can be ignored.
insert into t1 values (1, repeat("I", 80)), (2, repeat("R", 80));
First pass with replica_allow_batching OFF
set global replica_allow_batching=OFF;
show variables like 'replica_allow_batching';
Variable_name	Value
replica_allow_batching	OFF
Check out batching
Transaction includes deletes + inserts, and
two different tables, shouldn't be entirely batchable
without replica_allow_batching
begin;
delete from t1;
insert into t1 values (3, repeat("I", 80)), (4, repeat("F", 80));
insert into t2 values (5, repeat("B", 90)), (6, repeat("E", 90));

Second pass with replica_allow_batching ON
set global replica_allow_batching=ON;
show variables like 'replica_allow_batching';
Variable_name	Value
replica_allow_batching	ON
Check out batching
Transaction includes deletes + inserts, and
two different tables, shouldn't be batchable

Determine slave activity in terms of PK ops and execute() calls
Check that test compared like-for-like, and that replica_allow_batching
came out ahead by a factor of at least 2.
SELECT @batching_on_pk_ops = @batching_off_pk_ops AS 'Fair contest';
Fair contest

SELECT @batching_off_pk_ops >=4 as 'Batching can improve matters';
Batching can improve matters

SELECT @batching_on_execs * 2 < @batching_off_execs AS 'replica_allow_batching works';
