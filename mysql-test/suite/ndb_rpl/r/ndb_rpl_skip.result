create table t1 (a int not null, b int, c int, unique(c)) engine=ndb;
Insert some records
Connect to replica and ensure data is there.

Make a replica side change
This can cause uniqueness violations when we replicate data
insert into t1 values (2001,2001,1001);
insert into t1 values (2002,2002,1002);
insert into t1 values (2003,2003,1003);
Scenario 1 : skipping causes problem with epoch sequence check
--------------------------------------------------------------
Cause a conflict
insert into t1 values (1001,1001,1001);
Sync with master, will succeed
Show that row was not replicated to slave
select * from t1 where a=1001;
a	b	c
Show that subsequent changes cause an error
insert into t1 values (3000,3000,3000);
Expect replication to stop with an error
include/wait_for_slave_sql_error.inc [errno=1296]
Data not replicated
select * from t1 where a=3000;
a	b	c
Simply starting the slave again should be enough
to move on
start replica;
Data now replicated
select * from t1 where a=3000;
a	b	c
3000	3000	3000
Scenario 2 : ndb_applier_allow_skip_epoch avoids slave stop
-----------------------------------------------------------
show variables like 'ndb_applier_allow_skip_epoch';
Variable_name	Value
ndb_applier_allow_skip_epoch	OFF
set global ndb_applier_allow_skip_epoch = 1;
