Setup ndb_replication and t1 exceptions table
Populate ndb_replication table as necessary
create table test.t1 (
a int primary key,
b int,
c varchar(2000)) engine=ndb;
insert into test.t1 values (1,1,repeat("B", 1000));
Stopping Primary -> Secondary replication
STOP REPLICA;
Stopping Secondary -> Primary replication

Making change on Primary
update test.t1 set b=2 where a=1;
Making conflicting change on Secondary
begin;
update test.t1 set b=3 where a=1;
insert into test.t1 values (2,2,repeat("A", 1000));

Capturing session epoch from Master
Show that last_conflict_epoch is 0
Variable_name	Value
Ndb_conflict_last_conflict_epoch	0
Restart Secondary->Primary replication
Check that max_replicated_epoch is 
still < the saved session epoch
Max replicated epoch should be < committed epoch
@max_replicated_epoch < @master_session_epoch

Some invariants :
@conflict_detected_epoch != 0
1
@conflict_detected_epoch > @max_replicated_epoch
1
Primary has detected the problem, but Secondary
is unaware as the slave is offline.
Now bring it back
Now sync up
Now lets check that the max replicated epoch
on the Primary is == the last_conflict_epoch
@max_replicated_epoch = @conflict_detected_epoch
