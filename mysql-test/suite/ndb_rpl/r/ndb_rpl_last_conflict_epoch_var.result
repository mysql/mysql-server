Populate ndb_replication table as necessary
create table test.t1 (
a int primary key,

c varchar(2000)) engine=ndb;
insert into test.t1 values (1,1,repeat("B", 1000));

Making change on Primary
update test.t1 set b=2 where a=1;
Making conflicting change on Secondary
begin;
update test.t1 set b=3 where a=1;
insert into test.t1 values (2,2,repeat("A", 1000));

Restart Secondary->Primary replication
Warnings:
Warning	1287	'START SLAVE' is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use START REPLICA instead
Check that max_replicated_epoch is 
still < the saved session epoch
Max replicated epoch should be < committed epoch
@max_replicated_epoch < @master_session_epoch

Some invariants :
@conflict_detected_epoch != 0

@conflict_detected_epoch > @max_replicated_epoch

Primary has detected the problem, but Secondary
is unaware as the slave is offline.
Now bring it back
Warnings:
Warning	1287	'START SLAVE' is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use START REPLICA instead
Now sync up
Now lets check that the max replicated epoch
on the Primary is == the last_conflict_epoch
@max_replicated_epoch = @conflict_detected_epoch
