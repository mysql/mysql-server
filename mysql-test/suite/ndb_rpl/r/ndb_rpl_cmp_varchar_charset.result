Update content on master, remove trailing spaces
update t1 set str="one" where id="1";
select concat("<<<",str,">>>") from t1;
concat("<<<",str,">>>")
<<<one>>>
Verify the slave update, no trailing spaces anymore!
select concat("<<<",str,">>>") from t1;
concat("<<<",str,">>>")
<<<one>>>
Double check: Master update it back to original value
update t1 set str="one                   " where id="1";
select concat("<<<",str,">>>") from t1;
concat("<<<",str,">>>")
<<<one                   >>>
Verify the replica update, see trailing space again
select concat("<<<",str,">>>") from t1;
concat("<<<",str,">>>")
<<<one                   >>>
drop table t1;
