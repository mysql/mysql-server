Allow propagation to Primary
PRIMARY:
Expect:
- NDB$EPOCH_TRANS :
- Will not detect delete-delete conflict, so first
Secondary transaction will apply row 73.
- Unrelated transaction from Secondary (84) is present
- Following insert on delete-delete conflict row (77) is not in conflict,
so both it and the related row from the same transaction (80) are present
This applies whether the following insert is in the same or a different
epoch
Divergence:
- Primary will have 73,84,77,80
- Secondary will have 73,84,80, no 77

- NDB$EPOCH_TRANS2 :
- Will detect delete-delete conflict, so first 
Secondary transaction will not apply (no row 73)
77 and 73 will be refreshed (DEL)
- Unrelated transaction from Secondary (84) is present and applied
84 will be reflected (INS)
- Following insert on delete-delete conflict row (77) will be found in 
conflict iff this transaction is in the same epoch as the first 
conflicting transaction.  If it is in a different epoch then it will
not be found in conflict, as there will be no state available to 
use.
- If it is in-conflict, then 77 and 80 will be refreshed (DEL)
Result on both should be :
84
- If it is not in-conflict, then 77 and 80 will be reflected (INS)
Result on both should be :
84, 77, 80
No divergence

Expected Behaviour
EPOCH_TRANS

1.  Conflict between Primary update to 6 + Secondary
[Delete of 6 + Insert of 7] is detected by Primary
and transaction is not applied at the Primary.
Rows 6 (INS) and 7 (DEL) are refreshed.  Row 6 has its 
epoch updated.

2.  Following Secondary transaction, [delete of 7
+ insert of 8] behaviour depends on whether it
arrives in the same or a different epoch.
Same epoch : 
Will conflict with refreshed row 7, and so will
not be applied.  Row 8 will be refreshed (DEL)
Different epoch :
Will not conflict with Not-present row 7, and so
will be applied.

3.  On the Secondary, the observed sequence will be :
- Update 6 from PRIMARY : (Idempotent insert)
- Refresh (INS) 6 from PRIMARY
- Refresh (DEL) 7 from PRIMARY
Same epoch :
- Refresh (DEL) 8 from PRIMARY
Different epoch :
- Nothing

Results (no divergence) :
Same epoch :
PRIMARY : 6
SECONDARY : 6
Diff epoch :
PRIMARY : 6,8
SECONDARY : 6,8


EPOCH_TRANS2

1.  Conflict between Primary update to 6 + Secondary
[Delete of 6 + Insert of 7] is detected by Primary
and transaction is not applied at the Primary.
Rows 6 (INS) and 7 (DEL) are refreshed.  Row 6 has its 
epoch updated.

2.  Following Secondary transaction [delete of 7 + 
insert of 8] will conflict with the first 
transaction as EPOCH_TRANS2 does not allow
a delete of an already deleted row.
Row 7 will be refreshed (DEL) and row 8 will be 
refreshed (DEL)

3.  On the Secondary, the observed sequence will be :
- Update 6 from PRIMARY : (Idempotent insert)
- Refresh (INS) 6 from PRIMARY
- Refresh (DEL) 7 from PRIMARY
- [Refresh (DEL) 7 from PRIMARY] - diff epoch
- Refresh (DEL) 8 from PRIMARY

Results (no divergence) :
PRIMARY : 6
SECONDARY : 6
