# Bug#33974581 Update of table with hidden key stops applier
#
# When Applier process changes to a hidden key table it need to read
# from NDB instead of just defining another update or write. Before the
# read can take place, any already defined operations need to be sent to
# NDB. This is done both in order to "read your own writes" as well as
# handle constraint violation and missing row errors in the same way as
# if the table with hidden key was not changed.
#
#
# 1) This test shows "read your own write" for table with hidden pk.
# Since the table has hidden pk the UPDATE will need to read rows
# from NDB, find the ones that match the condition and then update those.
# In order to make it possible for NDB to return the first INSERT it
# need to be prepared/flushed before starting to read.
