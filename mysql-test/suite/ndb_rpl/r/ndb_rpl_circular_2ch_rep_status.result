Allow it to propagate to Cluster B
Originate a second unrelated change at Cluster B, to allow us to wait for
reverse propagation in the testcase

Flush logs to ensure any pending update (e.g. reflected apply_status write row)
is skipped over.

There is no new Max Rep Epoch from Cluster A as it has not changed
anything yet

Propagate to Cluster B
Make change on Cluster B to allow waiting for reverse propagation
