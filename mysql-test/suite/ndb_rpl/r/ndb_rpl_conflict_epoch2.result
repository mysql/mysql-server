Testing NDB algorithm
NDB is almost the same as NDB, except that:
- The Primary / Secondary roles are controlled by a server variable
- Secondary I/U/D ops are 'reflected' back to the Secondary to handle
the delete vs delete limitations of NDB

This testcase provides some regression coverage w.r.t. NDB, by
running many of the same tests on NDB, but also switching
the cluster roles.
The main result differences w.r.t ndb_rpl_conflict_epoch.result are :
- Result file has 2 passes for different roles
- Master and Local server ids swapped in second run
- Delete-Delete-Insert (case 8) shows no divergence

Prior to including the generic NDB test files, we setup the
conflict role variables
Setup connections for use in this file
First we have Cluster A as Primary, Cluster B as Secondary
SET GLOBAL ndb_applier_conflict_role="PRIMARY";
SET GLOBAL ndb_applier_conflict_role="SECONDARY";
