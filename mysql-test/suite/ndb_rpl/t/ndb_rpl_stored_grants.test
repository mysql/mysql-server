# This test case demonstrates the relationship between NDB distributed users
# and MySQL replication.
# Some rules:
#  - Any ACL change executed on a binlogging server will be written to the
#    binlog there. This includes changes to a local users on the binlogging
#    server, as well as changes to NDB_STORED_USER users on that cluster.
#  - Setting SQL_LOG_BIN=0 before a change should prevent it from being
#    written to the binlog. This includes a change to an NDB stored user
#    issued on a non-binlogging server.
#  - Setting log_replica_updates=0 should prevent ACL changes from being
#    propagated.
#  - Every ACL change should be correctly tagged in binlogs with the
#    server_id of its origin server.

#
#  Cluster 1              Cluster 2
#  ---------              ---------
#     A   --> binlog -->     C   --> binlog ( log_replica_updates=0 )
#     B                      D   --> binlog ( log_replica_updates=1 )

# On server (A), sql_log_bin is set to 0, and then a user with
