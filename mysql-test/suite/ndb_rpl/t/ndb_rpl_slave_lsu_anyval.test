# Description :
#   Test that using server-id-bits and composite AnyValues works in that.
#   1) Composite AnyValues are correctly split into ServerId and UserData
#      by MySQLDs listening to NdbApi events.
#   2) Composite AnyValues are placed into the ServerId of events in the
#      Binary logs of attached binlogging MySQLDs
#   3) Composite ServerIds are correctly split into ServerId by the replication
#      framework on the slave-side for the purposes of :
#      a) Loop detection
#      b) ndb_apply_status updates
#   4) Composite ServerIds are placed into the composite AnyValues of row
#      operations by the slave
#   5) Binlogging MySQLDs on the slave correctly identify replicated composite
#      AnyValues as being replicated.
#
# This test is a re-run of rpl_ndb_slave_lsu with different configuration :
#   a) server-id-bits is set to 7, implying that :
#      - Only the bottom 7 bits of event ServerIds written to the Binlog are
#        set to the ServerId.  The other bits come from the event AnyValue
#        received by the Binlog injector. 
#      - Only the bottom 7 bits of ServerIds received in Binlogs are used as
#        the ServerId in the Slave, the other bits are ignored, but are placed
#        in the AnyValue of resulting NdbApi operations.
#   b) NDB_TEST_ANYVALUE_USERDATA is set to Y
#      - This causes MySQLD to set the UserData part of the AnyValue (in this
#        case bits 8-30) to '1'.
#        This results in AnyValues and replicated ServerIds having an 'offset'
#        of 2^24 << 7 == 2147483520
#        This offset can be seen when comparing the SHOW BINLOG EVENTS ServerId
#        values (which use the server-id-bits to only show the server-id, to 
#        output from the mysqlbinlog tool when it passed no server-id-bits
#        option, and shows the full serverid.
#        It can be seen that events originating on the master are given a
#        composite server id which is available at the slave as it is written
#        into the binlog of the slave running with --log-replica-updates on.
#
#   NOTE! The main difference between this test and ndb_rpl_slave_lsu is that
#   the output "SHOW BINLOG EVENTS" will show the actual server_id while the
#   the output from "mysqlbinlog" will show the full anyvalue (which contains
#   both the server_id as well as other flags transported between servers
#   in the anyvalue).
