# Where multiple user transactions from the Secondary site are
# involved, the actual number of rows in-conflict, the number
# of epoch transactions with conflicts, and the number of
# iterations, vary depending on the distribution of the user
# transactions across epochs.  e.g. if 3 transactions are in
# one epoch (and executed in one batch), then only actual
# conflicts will be recorded, but if they are separated, then
# implied rows may conflict as well.  This can make these
# counter values non-deterministic, so this .inc file is used
# to check that the stable counters are correct.  The stable
# counters are the number of rejected rows, and the number
# of rejected transactions, which must be the same, regardless
# of how the epoch boundaries lie.
