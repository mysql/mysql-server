# ==== Purpose ====
# The purpose of this script is to test that binary logging returns an error
# if more than one engine is involved and at least one of them it's doing its
# own logging (is *self-logging*), which is the case for NDB engine.
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# R1. When more than one engine is involved in binary logging and at least one
#     engine is self-logging then binary logging should return error
#     `ER_BINLOG_MULTIPLE_ENGINES_AND_SELF_LOGGING_ENGINE`.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# TC1. Verify that when more than one engine is involved in binary logging and
#      at least one engine is self-logging then binary logging should return
#      error `ER_BINLOG_MULTIPLE_ENGINES_AND_SELF_LOGGING_ENGINE`.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# With BINLOG_FORMAT = ROW :
# 1) Create a trigger which inserts data in MYISAM engine upon insertion of
#    data in NDB engine.
# 2) Try to insert data in the NDB ENGINE.
# 3) Verify that error `ER_BINLOG_ROW_ENGINE_AND_STMT_ENGINE` is returned.
# 4) Verify that no data was inserted in the NDB engine.
# 5) Verify that no data was inserted in MYISAM engine.

# ==== Related test cases ====
#
# rpl.rpl_binlog_format_errors verifies that binary logging returns an error
# for the conditions 1 to 7 listed in the comments section of method
# decide_logging_format(). Condition 8 requires a self-logging engine which
# is the case of NDB and therefore it is tested in this script.

# The test changes binlog_format, so there is no reason to run it
# under more than one binlog format.
