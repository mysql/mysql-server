--echo # Bug#33974581 Update of table with hidden key stops applier
--echo #
--echo # When Applier process changes to a hidden key table it need to read
--echo # from NDB instead of just defining another update or write. Before the
--echo # read can take place, any already defined operations need to be sent to
--echo # NDB. This is done both in order to "read your own writes" as well as
--echo # handle constraint violation and missing row errors in the same way as
--echo # if the table with hidden key was not changed.
--echo #

--echo #
--echo # 1) This test shows "read your own write" for table with hidden pk.
--echo # Since the table has hidden pk the UPDATE will need to read rows
--echo # from NDB, find the ones that match the condition and then update those.
--echo # In order to make it possible for NDB to return the first INSERT it
--echo # need to be prepared/flushed before starting to read.
# NOTE! There is no guarantee that the two statements are binlogged in a single
# epoch transaction (and so testing the fix),
