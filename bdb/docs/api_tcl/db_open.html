<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The <b>berkdb open</b> command opens, and optionally creates, a database.
The returned database handle is bound to a Tcl command of the form
<b>dbN</b>, where N is an integer starting at 0 (e.g., db0 and db1).
It is through this Tcl command that the script accesses the database
methods.
<p>The options are as follows:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>-btree<dd>Open/create a database of type Btree.  The Btree format
is a representation of a sorted, balanced tree structure.
<p><dt>-hash<dd>Open/create a database of type Hash.  The Hash format is
an extensible, dynamic hashing scheme.
<p><dt>-queue<dd>Open/create a database of type Queue.  The Queue format
supports fast access to fixed-length records accessed by sequentially or
logical record number.
<p><dt>-recno<dd>Open/create a database of type Recno.  The Recno format
supports fixed- or variable-length records, accessed sequentially or by
logical record number, and optionally retrieved from a flat text file.
<p><dt>-unknown<dd>The database is of an unknown type, and must already exist.
<p><dt>-cachesize {gbytes bytes ncache}<dd>Set the size of the database's shared memory buffer pool, i.e., the cache,
to <b>gbytes</b> gigabytes plus <b>bytes</b>.  The cache should be the
size of the normal working data set of the application, with some small
amount of additional memory for unusual situations.  (Note, the working
set is not the same as the number of simultaneously referenced pages, and
should be quite a bit larger!)
<p>The default cache size is 256KB, and may not be specified as less than
20KB.  Any cache size less than 500MB is automatically increased by 25%
to account for buffer pool overhead, cache sizes larger than 500MB are
used as specified.
<p>It is possible to specify caches to Berkeley DB that are large enough so that
they cannot be allocated contiguously on some architectures, e.g., some
releases of Solaris limit the amount of memory that may be allocated
contiguously by a process.  If <b>ncache</b> is 0 or 1, the cache will
be allocated contiguously in memory.  If it is greater than 1, the cache
will be broken up into <b>ncache</b> equally sized separate pieces of
memory.
<p>For information on tuning the Berkeley DB cache size, see
<a href="../ref/am_conf/cachesize.html">Selecting a cache size</a>.
<p>As databases opened within Berkeley DB environments use the cache specified to
the environment, it is an error to attempt to set a cache in a database
created within an environment.
<p><dt>-create<dd>Create any underlying files, as necessary. If the files do not already
exist and the <b>-create</b> argument is not specified, the call will
fail.
<p><dt>-delim delim<dd>Set the delimiting byte used to mark the end of a record in the backing
source file for the Recno access method.
<p>This byte is used for variable length records, if the <b>-source</b>
argument file is specified.  If the <b>-source</b> argument file is
specified and no delimiting byte was specified, &lt;newline&gt;
characters (i.e. ASCII 0x0a) are interpreted as end-of-record markers.
<p><dt>-dup<dd>Permit duplicate data items in the tree, i.e. insertion when the key of the
key/data pair being inserted already exists in the tree will be successful.
The ordering of duplicates in the tree is determined by the order of
insertion, unless the ordering is otherwise specified by use of a cursor or
a duplicate comparison function.
<p>It is an error to specify both <b>-dup</b> and <b>-recnum</b>.
<p><dt>-dupsort<dd>Sort duplicates within a set of data items.  A default, lexical comparison
will be used.  Specifying that duplicates are to be sorted changes the
behavior of the <i>db</i> <b>put</b> operation as well as the <i>dbc</i> <b>put</b>
operation when the <b>-keyfirst</b>, <b>-keylast</b> and
<b>-current</b> options are specified.
<p><dt>-env env<dd>If no <b>-env</b> argument is given, the database is standalone, i.e.,
it is not part of any Berkeley DB environment.
<p>If a <b>-env</b> argument is given, the database is created within the
specified Berkeley DB environment. The database access methods automatically
make calls to the other subsystems in Berkeley DB based on the enclosing
environment. For example, if the environment has been configured to use
locking, then the access methods will automatically acquire the correct
locks when reading and writing pages of the database.
<p><dt>-errfile filename<dd>
<p>When an error occurs in the Berkeley DB library, a Berkeley DB error or an error
return value is returned by the function. In some cases, however, the
errno value may be insufficient to completely describe the cause of the
error especially during initial application debugging.
<p>The <b>-errfile</b> argument is used to enhance the mechanism for
reporting error messages to the application by specifying a file to be
used for displaying additional Berkeley DB error messages. In some cases, when
an error occurs, Berkeley DB will output an additional error message to the
specified file reference.
<p>The error message will consist of a Tcl command name and a colon (":"),
an error string, and a trailing &lt;newline&gt; character.  If the
database was opened in an environment the Tcl command name will be the
environment name (e.g., env0), otherwise it will be the database command
name (e.g., db0).
<p>This error logging enhancement does not slow performance or significantly
increase application size, and may be run during normal operation as well
as during application debugging.
<p>For database handles opened inside of Berkeley DB environments, specifying the
<b>-errfile</b> argument affects the entire environment and is equivalent
to specifying the same argument to the <b>berkdb env</b> command.
<p><dt>-excl<dd>Return an error if the file already exists. Underlying filesystem
primitives are used to implement this flag.  For this reason it is only
applicable to the physical database file and cannot be used to test if a
database in a file already exists.
<p><dt>-extent size<dd>Set the size of the extents of the Queue database,  The size is specified
as the number of pages in an extent.
Each extent is created as a separate physical file. If no extent size
is set, the default behavior is to create only
a single underlying database file.
<p>For information on tuning the extent size, see
<a href="../ref/am_conf/extentsize.html">Selecting a extent size</a>.
<p><dt>-ffactor density<dd>Set the desired density within the hash table.
<p>The density is an approximation of the number of keys allowed to
accumulate in any one bucket
<p><dt>-len len<dd>For the Queue access method, specify that the records are of length
<b>len</b>.
<p>For the Recno access method, specify that the records are fixed-length,
not byte delimited, and are of length <b>len</b>.
<p>Any records added to the database that are less than <b>len</b> bytes
long are automatically padded (see the <b>-pad</b> argument for more
information).
<p>Any attempt to insert records into the database that are greater than
<b>len</b> bytes long will cause the call to fail immediately and return
an error.
<p><dt>-mode mode<dd>
<p>On UNIX systems, or in IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX) environments, all files created by the access methods
are created with mode <b>mode</b> (as described in <b>chmod</b>(2)) and
modified by the process' umask value at the time of creation (see
<b>umask</b>(2)).  The group ownership of created files is based on
the system and directory defaults, and is not further specified by Berkeley DB.
If <b>mode</b> is 0, files are created readable and writeable by both
owner and group.  On Windows systems, the mode argument is ignored.
<p><dt>-nelem size<dd>Set an estimate of the final size of the hash table.
<p>If not set or set too low, hash tables will still expand gracefully as
keys are entered, although a slight performance degradation may be
noticed.
<p><dt>-pad pad<dd>Set the padding character for short, fixed-length records for the Queue
and Recno access methods.
<p>If no pad character is specified, &lt;space&gt; characters (i.e.,
ASCII 0x20) are used for padding.
<p><dt>-pagesize pagesize<dd>Set the size of the pages used to hold items in the database, in bytes.
The minimum page size is 512 bytes and the maximum page size is 64K bytes.
If the page size is not explicitly set, one is selected based on the
underlying filesystem I/O block size.  The automatically selected size
has a lower limit of 512 bytes and an upper limit of 16K bytes.
<p>For information on tuning the Berkeley DB page size, see
<a href="../ref/am_conf/pagesize.html">Selecting a page size</a>.
<p><dt>-rdonly<dd>Open the database for reading only. Any attempt to modify items in the
database will fail regardless of the actual permissions of any underlying
files.
<p><dt>-recnum<dd>Support retrieval from the Btree using record numbers.
<p>Logical record numbers in Btree databases are mutable in the face of
record insertion or deletion. See the <b>-renumber</b> argument for
further discussion.
<p>Maintaining record counts within a Btree introduces a serious point of
contention, namely the page locations where the record counts are stored. In
addition, the entire tree must be locked during both insertions and
deletions, effectively single-threading the tree for those operations.
Specifying <b>-recnum</b> can result in serious performance degradation
for some applications and data sets.
<p>It is an error to specify both <b>-dup</b> and <b>-recnum</b>.
<p><dt>-renumber<dd>Specifying the <b>-renumber</b> argument causes the logical record
numbers to be mutable, and change as records are added to and deleted from
the database.  For example, the deletion of record number 4 causes records
numbered 5 and greater to be renumbered downward by 1. If a cursor was
positioned to record number 4 before the deletion, it will reference the
new record number 4, if any such record exists, after the deletion. If a
cursor was positioned after record number 4 before the deletion, it will
be shifted downward 1 logical record, continuing to reference the same
record as it did before.
<p>Using the <i>db</i> <b>put</b> or <i>dbc</i> <b>put</b> interfaces to create new records will
cause the creation of multiple records if the record number is more than one
greater than the largest record currently in the database. For example,
creating record 28, when record 25 was previously the last record in the
database, will create records 26 and 27 as well as 28.
<p>If a created record is not at the end of the database, all records following
the new record will be automatically renumbered upward by 1. For example,
the creation of a new record numbered 8 causes records numbered 8 and
greater to be renumbered upward by 1. If a cursor was positioned to record
number 8 or greater before the insertion, it will be shifted upward 1
logical record, continuing to reference the same record as it did before.
<p>For these reasons, concurrent access to a Recno database with the
<b>-renumber</b> flag specified may be largely meaningless, although it
is supported.
<p><dt>-snapshot<dd>This argument specifies that any specified <b>-source</b> file be read
in its entirety when the database is opened. If this argument is not
specified, the <b>-source</b> file may be read lazily.
<p><dt>-source file<dd>Set the underlying source file for the Recno access method.  The purpose
of the <b>-source</b> file is to provide fast access and modification
to databases that are normally stored as flat text files.
<p>If the <b>-source</b> argument is give, it specifies an underlying flat
text database file that is read to initialize a transient record number
index.  In the case of variable length records, the records are separated
as specified by <b>-delim</b>.  For example, standard UNIX byte stream
files can be interpreted as a sequence of variable length records
separated by &lt;newline&gt; characters.
<p>In addition, when cached data would normally be written back to the
underlying database file (e.g., the <i>db</i> <b>close</b> or <i>db</i> <b>sync</b>
commands are called), the in-memory copy of the database will be written
back to the <b>-source</b> file.
<p>By default, the backing source file is read lazily, i.e., records are not
read from the file until they are requested by the application.
<b>If multiple processes (not threads) are accessing a Recno database
concurrently and either inserting or deleting records, the backing source
file must be read in its entirety before more than a single process
accesses the database, and only that process should specify the backing
source argument as part of the <b>berkdb open</b> call.  See the <b>-snapshot</b>
argument for more information.</b>
<p><b>Reading and writing the backing source file specified by <b>-source</b>
cannot be transactionally protected because it involves filesystem
operations that are not part of the Berkeley DB transaction methodology.</b>
For this reason, if a temporary database is used to hold the records,
i.e., no <b>file</b> argument was specified to the <b>berkdb open</b> call,
it is possible to lose the contents of the <b>-file</b> file, e.g., if
the system crashes at the right instant.  If a file is used to hold the
database, i.e., a file name was specified as the <b>file</b> argument
to <b>berkdb open</b>, normal database recovery on that file can be used to
prevent information loss, although it is still possible that the contents
of <b>-source</b> will be lost if the system crashes.
<p>The <b>-source</b> file must already exist (but may be zero-length) when
<b>berkdb open</b> is called.
<p>It is not an error to specify a read-only <b>-source</b> file when
creating a database, nor is it an error to modify the resulting database.
However, any attempt to write the changes to the backing source file using
either the <i>db</i> <b>close</b> or <i>db</i> <b>sync</b> commands will fail, of course.
Specify the <b>-nosync</b> argument to the <i>db</i> <b>close</b> command will
stop it from attempting to write the changes to the backing file, instead,
they will be silently discarded.
<p>For all of the above reasons, the <b>-source</b> file is generally used
to specify databases that are read-only for Berkeley DB applications, and that
are either generated on the fly by software tools, or modified using a
different mechanism, e.g., a text editor.
<p><dt>-truncate<dd>Physically truncate the underlying file, discarding all previous databases
it might have held.  Underlying filesystem primitives are used to
implement this flag.  For this reason it is only applicable to the
physical file and cannot be used to discard databases within a file.
<p>The <b>-truncate</b> argument cannot be transaction protected, and it is
an error to specify it in a transaction protected environment.
<p><dt>-upgrade<dd>Upgrade the database represented by <b>file</b>, if necessary.
<p><b>Note: Database upgrades are done in place and are
destructive, e.g., if pages need to be allocated and no disk space is
available, the database may be left corrupted.  Backups should be made
before databases are upgraded.  See <a href="../ref/am/upgrade.html">Upgrading databases</a> for more information.</b>
<p><dt>--<dd>Mark the end of the command arguments.
<p><dt>file<dd>The name of a single physical file on disk that will be used to back the
database.
<p><dt>database<dd>The <b>database</b> argument allows applications to have multiple
databases inside of a single physical file.  This is useful when the
databases are both numerous and reasonably small, in order to avoid
creating a large number of underlying files.  It is an error to attempt
to open a second database file that was not initially created using a
<b>database</b> name.
</dl>
<p>The <b>berkdb open</b> command returns a database handle on success.
<p>In the case of error, a Tcl error is thrown.
