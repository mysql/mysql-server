<h3><pre>
import com.sleepycat.db.*;
<p>
public int get(Dbt key, Dbt data, int flags)
	throws DbException;
</pre></h3>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The Dbc.get method retrieves key/data pairs from the database.  The
byte array and length of the key
are returned in the object referenced by <b>key</b> (except for the case
of the Db.DB_SET flag where the <b>key</b> object is unchanged),
and the byte array and length of
the data are returned in the object referenced by <b>data</b>.
<p>Modifications to the database during a sequential scan will be reflected
in the scan, i.e. records inserted behind a cursor will not be returned
while records inserted in front of a cursor will be returned.
<p>In Queue and Recno databases, missing entries (i.e., entries that were
never explicitly created or that were created and then deleted), will be
skipped during a sequential scan.
<p>If multiple threads or processes insert items into the same database file
without using locking, the results are undefined.
For more detail,
see <a href="../ref/am/stability.html">Cursor stability</a>.
<p>The <b>flags</b> parameter must be set to one of the following values:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_CURRENT">Db.DB_CURRENT</a><dd>Return the key/data pair currently referenced by the cursor.
<p>If the cursor key/data pair was deleted, Dbc.get will return
<a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_KEYEMPTY">Db.DB_KEYEMPTY</a>.
<p>If the cursor is not yet initialized, the Dbc.get method throws an exception that encapsulates EINVAL.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_FIRST">Db.DB_FIRST</a>, <a name="Db.DB_LAST">Db.DB_LAST</a><dd>The cursor is set to reference the first (last) key/data pair of the
database, and that pair is returned.  In the presence of duplicate key
values, the first (last) data item in the set of duplicates is returned.
<p>If the database is a Queue or Recno database, Dbc.get using the
Db.DB_FIRST (Db.DB_LAST) flags will ignore any keys that exist
but were never explicitly created by the application or were created and
later deleted.
<p>If the database is empty, Dbc.get will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">Db.DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_GET_BOTH">Db.DB_GET_BOTH</a><dd>The Db.DB_GET_BOTH flag is identical to the Db.DB_SET flag,
except that both the key and the data arguments must be matched by the
key and data item in the database.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_GET_RECNO">Db.DB_GET_RECNO</a><dd>Return the record number associated with the cursor.  The record number
will be returned in <b>data</b> as described in <a href="../api_java/dbt_class.html">Dbt</a>.  The
<b>key</b> parameter is ignored.
<p>For Db.DB_GET_RECNO to be specified, the underlying database must be
of type Btree and it must have been created with the <a href="../api_java/db_set_flags.html#DB_RECNUM">Db.DB_RECNUM</a>
flag.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_JOIN_ITEM">Db.DB_JOIN_ITEM</a><dd>Do not use the data value found in all of the cursors as a lookup key for
the primary database, but simply return it in the key parameter instead.
The data parameter is left unchanged.
<p>For Db.DB_JOIN_ITEM to be specified, the underlying cursor must have
been returned from the <a href="../api_java/db_join.html">Db.join</a> method.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_NEXT">Db.DB_NEXT</a>, <a name="Db.DB_PREV">Db.DB_PREV</a><dd>If the cursor is not yet initialized, Db.DB_NEXT (Db.DB_PREV)
is identical to Db.DB_FIRST (Db.DB_LAST).  Otherwise, the cursor
is moved to the next (previous) key/data pair of the database, and that
pair is returned.  In the presence of duplicate key values, the value of
the key may not change.
<p>If the database is a Queue or Recno database, Dbc.get using the
Db.DB_NEXT (Db.DB_PREV) flag will skip any keys that exist but
were never explicitly created by the application or were created and later
deleted.
<p>If the cursor is already on the last (first) record in the database,
Dbc.get will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">Db.DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_NEXT_DUP">Db.DB_NEXT_DUP</a><dd>If the next key/data pair of the database is a duplicate record for the
current key/data pair, the cursor is moved to the next key/data pair of
the database, and that pair is returned.  Otherwise, Dbc.get will
return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">Db.DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
<p>If the cursor is not yet initialized, the Dbc.get method throws an exception that encapsulates EINVAL.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_NEXT_NODUP">Db.DB_NEXT_NODUP</a>, <a name="Db.DB_PREV_NODUP">Db.DB_PREV_NODUP</a><dd>If the cursor is not yet initialized, Db.DB_NEXT_NODUP
(Db.DB_PREV_NODUP) is identical to Db.DB_FIRST
(Db.DB_LAST).  Otherwise, the cursor is moved to the next (previous)
non-duplicate key/data pair of the database, and that pair is returned.
<p>If the database is a Queue or Recno database, Dbc.get using the
Db.DB_NEXT_NODUP (Db.DB_PREV_NODUP) flags will ignore any keys
that exist but were never explicitly created by the application or were
created and later deleted.
<p>If no non-duplicate key/data pairs occur after (before) the cursor
position in the database, Dbc.get will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">Db.DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_SET">Db.DB_SET</a><dd>Move the cursor to the specified key/data pair of the database, and
return the datum associated with the given key.
<p>In the presence of duplicate key values, Dbc.get will return the
first data item for the given key.
<p>If the database is a Queue or Recno database and the requested key exists,
but was never explicitly created by the application or was later deleted,
Dbc.get will return <a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_KEYEMPTY">Db.DB_KEYEMPTY</a>.
<p>If no matching keys are found, Dbc.get will return
<a href="../ref/program/errorret.html#DB_NOTFOUND">Db.DB_NOTFOUND</a>.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_SET_RANGE">Db.DB_SET_RANGE</a><dd>The Db.DB_SET_RANGE flag is identical to the Db.DB_SET flag,
except that the key is returned as well as the data item, and, in the case
of the Btree access method, the returned key/data pair is the smallest
key greater than or equal to the specified key (as determined by the
comparison method), permitting partial key matches and range
searches.
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_SET_RECNO">Db.DB_SET_RECNO</a><dd>Move the cursor to the specific numbered record of the database, and
return the associated key/data pair.  The <b>data</b> field of the
specified <b>key</b>
must be a byte array containing a record number, as described in
<a href="../api_java/dbt_class.html">Dbt</a>.  This determines the record to be retrieved.
<p>For Db.DB_SET_RECNO to be specified, the underlying database must be
of type Btree and it must have been created with the <a href="../api_java/db_set_flags.html#DB_RECNUM">Db.DB_RECNUM</a>
flag.
</dl>
<p>In addition, the following flag may be set by bitwise inclusively <b>OR</b>'ing it into the
<b>flags</b> parameter:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><a name="Db.DB_RMW">Db.DB_RMW</a><dd>Acquire write locks instead of read locks when doing the retrieval.
Setting this flag may decrease the likelihood of deadlock during a
read-modify-write cycle by immediately acquiring the write lock during
the read part of the cycle so that another thread of control acquiring
a read lock for the same item, in its own read-modify-write cycle, will
not result in deadlock.
</dl>
<p>Otherwise, the Dbc.get method throws an exception that encapsulates a non-zero error value on
failure.
<p>If Dbc.get fails for any reason, the state of the cursor will be
unchanged.
<h1>Errors</h1>
<p>The Dbc.get method may fail and throw an exception encapsulating a non-zero error for the following conditions:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>EINVAL<dd>An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.
<p>The specified cursor was not currently initialized.
</dl>
<p>If the operation was selected to resolve a deadlock, the
Dbc.get method will fail and
throw a <a href="../api_java/deadlock_class.html">DbDeadlockException</a> exception.
<p>If the requested item could not be returned due to insufficient memory,
the Dbc.get method will fail and
throw a <a href="../api_java/mem_class.html">DbMemoryException</a> exception.
<p>The Dbc.get method may fail and throw an exception for errors specified for other Berkeley DB and C library or system methods.
If a catastrophic error has occurred, the Dbc.get method may fail and throw
a <a href="../api_java/runrec_class.html">DbRunRecoveryException</a>, in which case all subsequent Berkeley DB calls
will fail in the same way.
