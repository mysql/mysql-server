<h3><pre>db_upgrade [<b>-NsV</b>] [<b>-h home</b>] file ...</pre></h3>
<h1>Description</h1>
        <a name="3"><!--meow--></a>        <a name="4"><!--meow--></a>    
<p>The db_upgrade utility upgrades the Berkeley DB version of one or more
files and the databases they contain to the current release version.
<p>The options are as follows:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><b>-h</b><dd>Specify a home directory for the database environment; by
default, the current working directory is used.
<p><dt><b>-N</b><dd>Do not acquire shared region locks while running.  Other problems such as
potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB will be ignored as well.  This option
is intended only for debugging errors and should not be used under any
other circumstances.
<p><dt><b>-s</b><dd>This flag is only meaningful when upgrading databases from releases before the
Berkeley DB 3.1 release.
<p>As part of the upgrade from the Berkeley DB 3.0 release to the 3.1 release, the
on-disk format of duplicate data items changed. To correctly upgrade the
format requires applications specify if duplicate data items in the
database are sorted or not. Specifying the <b>-s</b> flag means that
the duplicates are sorted, otherwise they are assumed to be unsorted.
Incorrectly specifying the value of this flag may lead to database
corruption.
<p>Because the db_upgrade utility upgrades a physical file (including
all of the databases it contains), it is not possible to use
db_upgrade to upgrade files where some of the databases it
includes have sorted duplicate data items and some of the databases it
includes have unsorted duplicate data items. If the file does not have
more than a single database, or the databases do not support duplicate
data items, or all of the databases that support duplicate data items
support the same style of duplicates (either sorted or unsorted),
db_upgrade will work correctly as long as the <b>-s</b> flag is
correctly specified. Otherwise, the file cannot be upgraded using
db_upgrade, and must be upgraded manually using the <a href="../utility/db_dump.html">db_dump</a>
and <a href="../utility/db_load.html">db_load</a> utilities.
<p><dt><b>-V</b><dd>Write the version number to the standard output and exit.
</dl>
<p><b>It is important to realize that Berkeley DB database upgrades are done
in place, and so are potentially destructive.</b> This means that if the
system crashes during the upgrade procedure, or if the upgrade procedure
runs out of disk space, the databases may be left in an inconsistent and
unrecoverable state.  See <a href="../ref/am/upgrade.html">Upgrading
databases</a> for more information.
<p>The db_upgrade utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the
<b>-h</b> option, the environment variable <b>DB_HOME</b>, or,
because the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB
environment).  In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB
environment, db_upgrade should always be given the chance to detach from
the environment and exit gracefully.  To cause db_upgrade to release all
environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal
(SIGINT).
<p>The db_upgrade utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.
<h1>Environment Variables</h1>
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>DB_HOME<dd>If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable
DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as described
in <a href="../api_c/env_open.html">DBENV-&gt;open</a>.
