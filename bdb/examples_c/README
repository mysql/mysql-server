ex_access.c	Using just the DB access methods.

ex_apprec	Application-specific recovery.

ex_btrec.c	Using the BTREE access method with record numbers.

ex_env.c	Setting up the DB environment.

ex_lock.c	Locking.

ex_mpool.c	Shared memory buffer pools.

ex_repquote	Replication.  This creates a toy stock quote server
		with DB's single-master, multiple-client replication,
		with communication over TCP.

ex_tpcb.c	TPC/B.
		Ex_tpcb sets up a framework in which to run a TPC/B test.
		Database initialization (the -i flag) and running the
		benchmark (-n flag) must take place separately (i.e.,
		first create the database, then run 1 or more copies of
		the benchmark).  Furthermore, when running more than one
		TPCB process, it is necessary to run the deadlock detector
		(db_deadlock), since it is possible for concurrent tpcb
		processes to deadlock.  For performance measurement, it
		will also be beneficial to run the db_checkpoint process
		as well.
