# add_harness_plugin - Add a new plugin target and set install

#
# The add_harness_plugin command will set up a new plugin target and
# also set the install location of the target correctly.
#
# Plugins that are normally put under the "lib" directory of the build
# root, but see the caveat in the next paragraph.
#
# If NO_INSTALL is provided, it will not be installed, which is useful
# if the plugin is only for testing purposes. These plugins are also
# left in their default location and not moved to the "lib"
# directory. If you want to move the plugin to some specific
# directory, you have to set the target property
# LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY yourself.
#
# If LOG_DOMAIN is given, it will be used as the log domain for the
# plugin. If no LOG_DOMAIN is given, the log domain will be the name
# of the plugin.
#
# DESTINATION specifies the directory where plugins will be installed.
# Providing it is compulsory unless NO_INSTALL is provided.
#
# Files provided after the SOURCES keyword are the sources to build
# the plugin from, while the files in the directory after INTERFACE
# will be installed alongside the header files for the harness.
#
# For plugins, it is necessary to set the RPATH so that the plugin can
# find other plugins when being loaded. This, unfortunately, means
# that the plugin path need to be set at compile time and cannot be
# changed after that.
