# The sources are re-built to test the metadata cache implementation with
# a store layer that can supply the metadata without an actual connection
# to the metadata node. In this case, mock_metadata.cc implements the metadata
# interface without implementing a connection to the underlying metadata node.
# The MockMetadata class does the functionality of the Metadata class.
