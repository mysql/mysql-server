/**
 * @defgroup MDC Metadata Cache
 *
 * Synopsis
 * ========
 *
 * Metadata Cache plugin communicates with Metadata and Group Replication
 * exposed by the cluster to obtain its topology and availablity information.
 * The digest of this information is then exposed to Routing Plugin in form of a
 * routing table.
 * Key components:
 * - Metadata Cache API - interface through which it exposes its service
 * - Refresh Mechansim - responsible for updating routing table
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Glossary
 * ========
 *
 * replicaset = group of servers that contain the same data; in simple cases
 *              replicaset and cluster are interchangeable, but in case of
 *              sharded cluster this no longer applies, as the cluster will be
 *              composed of multiple replicasets, each handling a different
 *              shard.
 *
 * MD = metadata, several tables residing on the metadata server, which (among
 *      other things) contain cluster topology information. It reflects the
 *      desired "as it should be" version of topology.
 *
 * GR = Group Replication, a server-side plugin responsible for synchronising
 *      data between cluster nodes. It exposes certain dynamic tables (views)
 *      that we query to obtain health status of the cluster. It reflects the
 *      real "as it actually is" version of topology.
 *
 * MDC = MD Cache, this plugin (the code that you're reading now).
 *
 * MM = multi-master, a replication mode in which all GR members are RW.
 *
 * SM = single-master, a replication mode in which only one GR member is RW,
 *      rest are RO.
 *
 * ATTOW = contraction for "at the time of writing".
 *
 * [xx] (where x is a digit) = reference to a note in Notes section.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Refresh Mechanism
 * =================
 *
 * @note
 * To keep docs simpler, all below describes how MDC behaves in case of handling
 * just one replicaset. It has been designed to handle more than one, however,
 * ATTOW we don't test it with more than one, so we are uncertain if it would
 * actually deliver on that promise.  This is also the reason why throughout the
 * MDC code there are data structures that are collections of replicasets and
 * for loops that iterate over them, yet in reality we always deal with just one
 * element in those containers and such loops iterate only once.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * ## Overview
 * MDC refresh runs in its own thread and periodically queries both MD and GR
 * for status, then updates routing table which is queried by the Routing
 * Plugin. Its entry point is `MetadataCache::start()`, which (indirectly) runs
 * a "forever loop" in `MetadataCache::refresh_thread()`, which in turn is
 * responsible for perodically running `MetadataCache::refresh()`.
 *
 * `MetadataCache::refresh()` is the "workhorse" of refresh mechanism.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * ## Refresh trigger
 * `MetadataCache::refresh_thread()` call to `MetadataCache::refresh()` can be
 * triggered in 2 ways:
 * - `<TTL>` seconds passed since last refresh
 * - emergency mode (replicaset is flagged to have at least one node
 * unreachable).
 *
 * It's implemented by running a sleep loop between refreshes. The loop sleeps 1
 * second at a time, until `<TTL>` iterations have gone or emergency mode is
 * enabled.
 *
 *
 *
 * ### Emergency mode
 * Emergency mode is entered, when Routing Plugin discovers that it's unable to
 * connect to a node that's declared by MDC as routable (node that is labelled
 * as writable or readonly). In such situation, it will flag the replicaset as
 * missing a node, and MDC will react by increasing refresh rate to 1/s (if it
 * is currently lower).
 *
 * This emergency mode will stay enabled, until routing table resulting from
 * most recent MD and GR query is different from the one before it _AND_ the
 * replicaset is in RW mode.
 *
 * @note
 * The reason why we require the routing table to be different before we disable
 * the emergency mode, is because it usually takes several seconds for GR to
 * figure out that some node went down. Thus we want to wait until GR gives us a
 * topology that reflects the change. This strategy might have a bug however
 * [05].
 *
 * @note
 * The reason why we require the replicaset to be in RW mode before we disable
 * the emergency mode, is the assumption that the user wants the replicaset to
 * be RW and if it is in RO, it is undergoing a failure. This assumption is
 * probably flawed [06].
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * ## Refresh process
 * Once refresh is called, it goes through the following stages:
 * - Stage 1: Query MD
 * - Stage 2: Query GR, combine results with MD, determine availability
 * - Stage 3: Update routing table
 *
 * In subsequent sections each stage is described in more detail
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * ### Stage 1: Query MD
 * This stage can be divided into two major substages:
 *   1. Connect to MD server
 *   2. Extract MD information
 *
 *
 *
 * #### Stage 1.1: Connect to MD server
 *
 * Implemented in: `ClusterMetadata::connect()`
 *
 * MDC starts with a list of MD servers written in the dynamic configuration
 * (state) file, such as:
 *
 *
 * "cluster-metadata-servers": [
 *          "mysql://192.168.56.101:3310",
 *          "mysql://192.168.56.101:3320",
 *          "mysql://192.168.56.101:3330"
 *      ]
 *
 * It iterates through the list and tries to connect to each one, until
 * connection succeeds.
 *
 * @note
 * This behavior might change in near future, because it does not ensure that
 * connected MD server holds valid MD data [01].
 *
 * @note
 * Iteration always starting from 1st server on the list might also change [02].
 *
 * @note
 * New connection is always established and old one closed off, even if old one
 * is still alive and usable.
 *
 *
 *
 * #### Stage 1.2: Extract MD Information
 *
 * Implemented in: `ClusterMetadata::fetch_instances_from_metadata_server()`
 *
 * Using connection established in Stage 1.1, MDC runs a SQL query which
 * extracts a list of nodes (GR members) belonging to the replicaset. Note that
 * this the configured "should be" view of replicaset topology, which might not
 * correspond to actual topology, if for example some nodes became unavailable,
 * changed their role or new nodes were added without updating MD in the
 * server.
 *
 * @note
 * ATTOW, if this query fails, whole refresh process fails [03].
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * ### Stage 2: Query GR, combine results with MD, determine availability
 *
 * Implemented in: `ClusterMetadata::update_replicaset_status()`
 *
 * Here MDC iterates through the list of GR members obtained from MD in Stage
 * 1.2, until it finds a "trustworthy" GR node. A "trustworthy" GR node is one
 * that passes the following substages:
 *   1. successfully connects
 *   2. successfully responds to 2 GR status SQL queries
 *   3. is part of quorum (regardless of whether it's available or not)
 *
 * If MDC doesn't find a "trustworthy" node, it clears the routing table,
 * resulting in Routing Plugin not routing any new connections.
 *
 * @note
 * Since Stage 2 got its list of candidate GR nodes from MD server, it follows
 * that MDC will never query any nodes not present in MD for GR status.
 *
 * @note
 * Any routing table updates will not go into effect until Stage 3, where it is
 * applied.
 *
 * @note
 * ATTOW clearing routing table will not automatically close off old
 * connections. This is a bug which is addressed by upcoming WL#11954.
 *
 *
 *
 * #### Stage 2.1: Connect to GR node
 *
 * Implemented in: `ClusterMetadata::update_replicaset_status()`
 *
 * New connection to GR node is established (on failure, Stage 2 progresses to
 * next iteration).
 *
 * @note
 * Since connection to MD server in Stage 1.1 is not closed after that stage
 * finishes, there's an optimisation done for when connecting to a GR member
 * that's the same node as the MD server - in such case, the connection is
 * simply re-used rather than new one opened.
 *
 *
 *
 * #### Stage 2.2: Extract GR status
 *
 * Implemented in: `fetch_group_replication_members()` and
 *                   `find_group_replication_primary_member()`
 *
 * Two SQL queries are ran and combined to produce a status report of all nodes
 * seen by this node (which would be the entire replicaset if it was in perfect
 * health, or its subset if some nodes became unavailable or the replicaset was
 * experiencing a split-brain scenario):
 *
 *   1. determine the PRIMARY member of the replicaset (if there is more than
 *      one, such as in MM setups, the first one is returned and the rest are
 *      ignored)
 *
 *   2. get the membership and health status of all GR nodes, as seen by this
 *      node
 *
 * If either SQL query fails to execute, Stage 2 iterates to next GR node.
 *
 * @note
 * ATTOW, 1st query is always ran, regardless of whether we're in MM mode or
 * not. As all nodes are PRIMARY in MM setups, we could optimise this query away
 * in MM setups.
 *
 *
 *
 * #### Stage 2.3: Quorum test
 *
 * Implemented in: `ClusterMetadata::update_replicaset_status()` and
 *                   `ClusterMetadata::check_replicaset_status()`
 *
 * MD and GR data collected up to now are compared, to see if GR node just
 * queried belongs to an available replicaset (or to an available replicaset
 * partition, if replicaset has partitioned). For a replicaset (partition) to
 * be considered available, it has to have quorum, that is, meet the following
 * condition:
 *
 *     count(ONLINE nodes) + count(RECOVERING nodes)
 *         is greater than
 *     1/2 * count(all original nodes according to MD).
 *
 * If particular GR node does not meet the quorum condition, Stage 2 iterates
 * to next GR node.
 *
 * OTOH, if GR node is part of quorum, Stage 2 will not iterate further,
 * because it would be pointless (it's not possible to find a member that's
 * part of another quorum, because there can only be one quorum, the one we
 * just found). This matters, because having quorum does not automatically
 * imply being available, as next paragraph explains.
 *
 * The availability test will resolve node's replicaset to be in of the 4
 * possible states:
 * - Unavailable (this node is not part of quorum)
 * - UnavailableRecovering (quorum is met, but it consists of only RECOVERING
 *   nodes - this is a rare cornercase)
 * - AvailableWritable (quorum is met, at least one RW node present)
 * - AvailableReadOnly (quorum is met, no RW nodes present)
 *
 * As already mentioned, reaching 1st of the 4 above states will result in
 * Stage 2 iterating to the next node. OTOH, achieving one of remaining 3
 * states will cause MDC to move on to Stage 3, where it sets the routing table
 * accordingly.
 *
 *
 * ##### GR-MD dishorenecy
 *
 * ATTOW, our Router has a certain limitation: it assumes that MD contains an
 * exact set or superset of nodes in GR. The user is normally expected to use
 * MySQL Shell to reconfigure the replicaset, which automatically updates both
 * GR and MD, keeping them in sync. But if for some reason the user tinkers with
 * GR directly and adds nodes without updating MD accordingly,
 * availablity/quorum calculations will be skewed. We run checks to detect such
 * situation, and log a warning like so:
 *
 *     log_error("Member %s:%d (%s) found in replicaset, yet is not defined in
 *     metadata!"
 *
 * but beyond that we just act defensively by having our quorum calculation be
 * conservative, and error on the side of caution when such discrepancy happens
 * (quorum becomes harder to reach than if MD contained all GR members).
 *
 * Quorum is evaluated in code as follows:
 *
 *     bool have_quorum = (quorum_count > member_status.size()/2);
 *
 * - `quorum_count` is the sum of PRIMARY, SECONDARY and RECOVERING nodes that
 *   appear in MD _and_ GR
 * - `member_status.size()` is the sum of all nodes in GR, regardless of if they
 *   show up in MD or not
 * - any nodes in MD but not in GR will be marked as Unavailable, this is an
 *   expected scenario, and we react correctly; they do not increment
 *   `quorum_count` nor `member_status.size()`
 * - any nodes in GR but not in MD will never become routing destinations,
 *   but they will increment the `member_status.size()`, making quorum harder to
 *   reach.
 *
 * To illustrate how our quorum calculation will behave when GR and MD get out
 * sync, below are some example scenarios:
 *
 * ###### Scenario 1
 *
 *     MD defines nodes A, B, C
 *     GR defines nodes A, B, C, D, E
 *     A, B are alive; C, D, E are dead
 *
 * Availability calculation should deem replicaset to be unavailable, because
 * only 2 of 5 nodes are alive, even though looking purely from MD
 * point-of-view, 2 of its 3 nodes are still alive, thus could be considered a
 * quorum. In such case:
 *
 *     quorum_count = 2 (A and B)
 *     member_status.size() = 5
 *
 * and thus:
 *
 *     have_quorum = (2 > 5/2) = false
 *
 * ###### Scenario 2
 *
 *     MD defines nodes A, B, C
 *     GR defines nodes A, B, C, D, E
 *     A, B are dead, C, D, E are alive
 *
 * Availability calculation, if fully GR-aware, could deem replicaset as
 * available, because looking from purely GR perspective, 3 of 5 nodes form
 * quorum. OTOH, looking from MD perspective, only 1 of 3 its nodes (C) is
 * alive.
 *
 * Our availability calculation prefers to err on the side of caution. So here
 * the availability is judged as not available, even though it could be. But
 * that's the price we pay in exchange for the safety the algorithm provides
 * demonstrated in the previous scenario:
 *
 *     quorum_count = 1 (C)
 *     member_status.size() = 5
 *
 * and thus:
 *
 *     have_quorum = (1 > 5/2) = false
 *
 * ###### Scenario 3
 *
 *     MD defines nodes A, B, C
 *     GR defines nodes       C, D, E
 *     A, B are not reported by GR, C, D, E are alive
 *
 * According to GR, there's a quorum between nodes C, D and E. However, from MD
 * point-of-view, A and B went missing and only C is known to be alive.
 *
 * Again, our available calculation prefers to err on the safe side:
 *
 *     quorum_count = 1 (C)
 *     member_status.size() = 5
 *
 * and thus:
 *
 *     have_quorum = (1 > 5/2) = false
 *
 *
 * ##### Why don't we just use GR data (and do away with Metadata)?
 *
 * Need for cluster configuration aside, there is another challenge. GR can
 * provide IP/hostnames of nodes as it sees them from its own perspective, but
 * those IP/hostnames might not be externally-reachable. OTOH, MD tables provide
 * external IP/hostnames which Router relies upon to reach the GR nodes.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * ### Stage 3: Update routing table
 *
 * Implemented in: `MetadataCache::refresh()`
 *
 * Once stage 2 is complete, the resulting routing table from Stage 2 is
 * applied. It is also compared to the old routing table and if there is a
 * difference between them, two things happen:
 *
 * 1. Appropriate log messages are issued advising of availability change.
 *
 * 2. A check is run if replicaset is in RW mode. If it is, emergency mode is
 *    called off (see "Emergency mode" section for more information).
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * ##NOTES
 *
 * ### Emergency mode
 * [05] Imagine a scenario where a replicaset is perfectly healthy, but Routing
 *      Plugin has a network hickup and fails to connect to one of its nodes. As
 *      a result, it will flag the replicaset as missing a node, triggerring
 *      emergency mode. Emergency mode will only be turned off after routing
 *      table changes (the assumption is that the current one is stale and we're
 *      waiting for an updated one reflecting the problem Routing Plugin
 *      observed). However, since the replicaset is healthy, as long as it stays
 *      that way no such update will come, leaving emergency mode enabled
 *      indefinitely. This has been reported as BUG#27065614
 *
 * [06] Requiring replicaset to be available in RW mode before disabling
 *      emergency mode has a flaw: if replicaset is placed in super-read-only
 *      mode, it is possible for PRIMARY node to be read-only.
 *
 *
 * ### Stage 1.1
 * [01] There has been a recent concern ATTOW, that MD returned might be stale,
 *      if MD server node is in RECOVERING state. This assumes the MD server is
 *      also deployed on an InnoDB cluster.
 *
 * [02] It might be better to always start from the last successfully-connected
 *      server, rather than 1st on the list, to avoid unneccessary connection
 *      attempts when 1st server is dead.
 *
 *
 * ### Stage 1.2
 * [03] If MD-fetching SQL statement fails to execute or process properly, it
 *      will raise an exception that is caught by the topmost catch of the
 *      refresh process, meaning, another MD server will not be queried. This is
 *      a bug, reported as BUG#28082473
