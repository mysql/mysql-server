# Generate dynamic_state_schema.cc
# With *one* common custom command, generating dynamic_state_schema.[cc|h]
# we had spurious build failures on Windows:
# CustomBuild: Failed to open output file 'dynamic_state_schema.cc':
# Permission denied
# Seems like Visual Studio wants to generate dynamic_state_schema.cc
# at least twice, once for the static library, once for the dynamic one.
# If both generation jobs run simultaneously, one of them may fail.
# The solution is to have separate commands, for the STATIC and SHARED targets.
