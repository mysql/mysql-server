  This class represents the character input stream consumed during lexical

  In addition to consuming the input stream, this class performs some comment
  pre processing, by filtering out out-of-bound special text from the query
  input stream.

  Two buffers, with pointers inside each, are maintained in parallel. The
  'raw' buffer is the original query text, which may contain out-of-bound
  comments. The 'cpp' (for comments pre processor) is the pre-processed buffer
  that contains only the query text that should be seen once out-of-bound data
  is removed.

    This problem does not arise for locks on stored routines as we don't
