 *
 * These tests are special - they test our component test framework rather than
 * our Router. For the tests we do here we need tailored simple executables
 * which communicate with our tests, serving as the other side of the test. To
 * avoid the overhead of having to create many small programs, instead we inline
 * their code here, inside of special disabled testcases, and we launch those
 * specific testcases from their corresponding real testcase. This is why all
 * the following tests are arranged in pairs, with names:
 *
 *   - "<test_description>_tester" (the test)
 *   - "DISABLED_<test_description>_testee" (the inlined executable)
 *
 * It's a hack, but it works.
