.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This program enables you to generate a bug report and send it to Oracle Corporation\&. It is a shell script and runs on Unix\&.
.PP
The normal way to report bugs is to visit
\m[blue]\fB\%http://bugs.mysql.com/\fR\m[], which is the address for our bugs database\&. This database is public and can be browsed and searched by anyone\&. If you log in to the system, you can enter new reports\&. If you have no Web access, you can generate a bug report by using the
\fBmysqlbug\fR
script\&.
.PP
\fBmysqlbug\fR
helps you generate a report by determining much of the following information automatically, but if something important is missing, please include it with your message\&.
\fBmysqlbug\fR
can be found in the
scripts
directory (source distribution) and in the
bin
directory under your MySQL installation directory (binary distribution)\&.
.PP
Invoke
\fBmysqlbug\fR
without arguments:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysqlbug\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The script will place you in an editor with a copy of the report to be sent\&. Edit the lines near the beginning that indicate the nature of the problem\&. Then write the file to save your changes, quit the editor, and
\fBmysqlbug\fR
will send the report by email\&.
