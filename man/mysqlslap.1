\fBmysqlslap [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysqlslap\fR
is a diagnostic program designed to emulate client load for a MySQL server and to report the timing of each stage. It works as if multiple clients are accessing the server.
\fBmysqlslap\fR
is available as of MySQL 5.1.4.
.PP
Invoke
\fBmysqlslap\fR
like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysqlslap [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
Some options such as
\fB\-\-create\fR
or
\fB\-\-query\fR
enable you to specify a string containing an SQL statement or a file containing statements. If you specify a file, by default it must contain one statement per line. (That is, the implicit statement delimiter is the newline character.) Use the
\fB\-\-delimiter\fR
option to specify a different delimiter, which enables you to specify statements that span multiple lines or place multiple statements on a single line. You cannot include comments in a file;
\fBmysqlslap\fR
does not understand them.
.PP
\fBmysqlslap\fR
runs in three stages:
.TP 3n
1.
Create schema, table, and optionally any stored programs or data you want to using for the test. This stage uses a single client connection.
.TP 3n
2.
Run the load test. This stage can use many client connections.
.TP 3n
3.
Clean up (disconnect, drop table if specified). This stage uses a single client connection.
.sp
.RE
.PP
Examples:
.PP
Supply your own create and query SQL statements, with 50 clients querying and 200 selects for each:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysqlslap \-\-delimiter=";" \\
  \-\-create="CREATE TABLE a (b int);INSERT INTO a VALUES (23)" \\
  \-\-query="SELECT * FROM a" \-\-concurrency=50 \-\-iterations=200
.fi
.RE
.PP
Let
\fBmysqlslap\fR
build the query SQL statement with a table of two
INT
columns and three
VARCHAR
columns. Use five clients querying 20 times each. Do not create the table or insert the data (that is, use the previous test's schema and data):
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysqlslap \-\-concurrency=5 \-\-iterations=20 \\
  \-\-number\-int\-cols=2 \-\-number\-char\-cols=3 \\
  \-\-auto\-generate\-sql
.fi
.RE
.PP
Tell the program to load the create, insert, and query SQL statements from the specified files, where the
\fIcreate.sql\fR
file has multiple table creation statements delimited by
\';'
and multiple insert statements delimited by
\';'. The
\fB\-\-query\fR
file will have multiple queries delimited by
\';'. Run all the load statements, then run all the queries in the query file with five clients (five times each):
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
mysqlslap \-\-concurrency=5 \\
  \-\-iterations=5 \-\-query=query.sql \-\-create=create.sql \\
  \-\-delimiter=";"
.fi

.PP
