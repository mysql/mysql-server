\fBreplace \fR\fB\fIarguments\fR\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBreplace\fR
utility program changes strings in place in files or on the standard input.
.PP
Invoke
\fBreplace\fR
in one of the following ways:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBreplace \fR\fB\fIfrom\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIto\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIfrom\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIto\fR\fR\fB] ... \-\- \fR\fB\fIfile_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIfile_name\fR\fR\fB] ...\fR
shell> \fBreplace \fR\fB\fIfrom\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIto\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIfrom\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIto\fR\fR\fB] ... < \fR\fB\fIfile_name\fR\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fIfrom\fR
represents a string to look for and
\fIto\fR
represents its replacement. There can be one or more pairs of strings.
.PP
Use the
\fB\-\-\fR
option to indicate where the string\-replacement list ends and the file names begin. In this case, any file named on the command line is modified in place, so you may want to make a copy of the original before converting it.
\fIreplace\fR
prints a message indicating which of the input files it actually modifies.
.PP
If the
\fB\-\-\fR
option is not given,
\fBreplace\fR
reads the standard input and writes to the standard output.
.PP
\fBreplace\fR
uses a finite state machine to match longer strings first. It can be used to swap strings. For example, the following command swaps
a
and
b
in the given files,
\fIfile1\fR
and
\fIfile2\fR:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBreplace a b b a \-\- file1 file2 ...\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
