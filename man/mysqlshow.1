\fBmysqlshow [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] [\fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fItbl_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIcol_name\fR\fR\fB]]]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBmysqlshow\fR
client can be used to quickly see which databases exist, their tables, or a table's columns or indexes.
.PP
\fBmysqlshow\fR
provides a command\-line interface to several SQL
SHOW
statements. See
Section\ 12.5.5, \(lqSHOW Syntax\(rq. The same information can be obtained by using those statements directly. For example, you can issue them from the
\fBmysql\fR
client program.
.PP
Invoke
\fBmysqlshow\fR
like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysqlshow [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] [\fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fItbl_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIcol_name\fR\fR\fB]]]\fR

.RE
.TP 3n
\(bu
If no database is given, a list of database names is shown.
.TP 3n
\(bu
If no table is given, all matching tables in the database are shown.
.TP 3n
\(bu
If no column is given, all matching columns and column types in the table are shown.
.sp
.RE
.PP
The output displays only the names of those databases, tables, or columns for which you have some privileges.
.PP
If the last argument contains shell or SQL wildcard characters (\(lq*\(rq,
\(lq?\(rq,
\(lq%\(rq, or
\(lq_\(rq), only those names that are matched by the wildcard are shown. If a database name contains any underscores, those should be escaped with a backslash (some Unix shells require two) to get a list of the proper tables or columns.
\(lq*\(rq
and
\(lq?\(rq
characters are converted into SQL
\(lq%\(rq
and
\(lq_\(rq
wildcard characters. This might cause some confusion when you try to display the columns for a table with a
\(lq_\(rq
in the name, because in this case,
\fBmysqlshow\fR
shows you only the table names that match the pattern. This is easily fixed by adding an extra
\(lq%\(rq
last on the command line as a separate argument.
.PP
\fBmysqlshow\fR
supports the following options:
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-help\fR,
\fB\-?\fR
.sp
Display a help message and exit.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-character\-sets\-dir=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp
The directory where character sets are installed. See
Section\ 9.2, \(lqThe Character Set Used for Data and Sorting\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-compress\fR,
\fB\-C\fR
.sp
Compress all information sent between the client and the server if both support compression.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-count\fR
.sp
Show the number of rows per table. This can be slow for non\-MyISAM
tables.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-debug[=\fR\fB\fIdebug_options\fR\fR\fB]\fR,
\fB\-# [\fR\fB\fIdebug_options\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.sp
Write a debugging log. The
\fIdebug_options\fR
string often is
\'d:t:o,\fIfile_name\fR'.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-debug\-check\fR
.sp
Print some debugging information when the program exits. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.21.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-debug\-info\fR
.sp
Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics when the program exits. This option was added in MySQL 5.1.14.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-default\-character\-set=\fR\fB\fIcharset_name\fR\fR
.sp
Use
\fIcharset_name\fR
as the default character set. See
Section\ 9.2, \(lqThe Character Set Used for Data and Sorting\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-host=\fR\fB\fIhost_name\fR\fR,
\fB\-h \fR\fB\fIhost_name\fR\fR
.sp
Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-keys\fR,
\fB\-k\fR
.sp
Show table indexes.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-password[=\fR\fB\fIpassword\fR\fR\fB]\fR,
\fB\-p[\fR\fB\fIpassword\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.sp
The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the short option form (\fB\-p\fR), you
\fIcannot\fR
have a space between the option and the password. If you omit the
\fIpassword\fR
value following the
\fB\-\-password\fR
or
\fB\-p\fR
option on the command line, you are prompted for one.
.sp
Specifying a password on the command line should be considered insecure. See
Section\ 5.5.6.2, \(lqEnd\-User Guidelines for Password Security\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-pipe\fR,
\fB\-W\fR
.sp
On Windows, connect to the server via a named pipe. This option applies only for connections to a local server, and only if the server supports named\-pipe connections.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-port=\fR\fB\fIport_num\fR\fR,
\fB\-P \fR\fB\fIport_num\fR\fR
.sp
The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}\fR
.sp
The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is useful when the other connection parameters normally would cause a protocol to be used other than the one you want. For details on the allowable values, see
Section\ 4.2.2, \(lqConnecting to the MySQL Server\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-show\-table\-type\fR,
\fB\-t\fR
.sp
Show a column indicating the table type, as in
SHOW FULL TABLES. The type is

\fB\-S \fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp
For connections to
localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-ssl*\fR
.sp
Options that begin with
\fB\-\-ssl\fR
specify whether to connect to the server via SSL and indicate where to find SSL keys and certificates. See
Section\ 5.5.7.3, \(lqSSL Command Options\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-status\fR,
\fB\-i\fR
.sp
Display extra information about each table.
.TP 3n
\(bu

\fB\-u \fR\fB\fIuser_name\fR\fR
.sp
The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.
.TP 3n
\(bu
