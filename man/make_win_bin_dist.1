.SH "NAME"
make_win_bin_dist \- package MySQL distribution as ZIP archive
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This script is used on Windows after building a MySQL distribution from source to create executable programs\&. It packages the binaries and support files into a ZIP archive that can be unpacked at the location where you want to install MySQL\&.
.PP
\fBmake_win_bin_dist\fR
is a shell script, so you must have Cygwin installed to use it\&.
.PP
This program\'s use is subject to change\&. Currently, you invoke it as follows from the root directory of your source distribution:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmake_win_bin_dist [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fIpackage_basename\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIcopy_def\fR\fR\fB \&.\&.\&.]\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The
\fIpackage_basename\fR
argument provides the basename for the resulting ZIP archive\&. This name will be the name of the directory that results from unpacking the archive\&.
.PP
Because you might want to include files of directories from other builds, you can instruct this script do copy them in for you, via
\fIcopy_def\fR
arguments, which of which is of the form
\fIrelative_dest_name\fR=\fIsource_name\fR\&.
.PP
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
bin/mysqld\-max\&.exe=\&.\&./my\-max\-build/sql/release/mysqld\&.exe
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
If you specify a directory, the entire directory will be copied\&.
.PP
\fBmake_win_bin_dist\fR
supports the following options\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
.\" make_win_bin_dist: debug option
.\" debug option: make_win_bin_dist
\fB\-\-debug\fR
.sp
Pack the debug binaries and produce an error if they were not built\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
.\" make_win_bin_dist: embedded option
.\" embedded option: make_win_bin_dist
\fB\-\-embedded\fR
.sp
Pack the embedded server and produce an error if it was not built\&. The default is to pack it if it was built\&.
.RE
.sp

.\" make_win_bin_dist: exe-suffix option
.\" exe-suffix option: make_win_bin_dist
\fB\-\-exe\-suffix=\fR\fB\fIsuffix\fR\fR
.sp
Add a suffix to the basename of the
\fBmysql\fR
binary\&. For example, a suffix of
\-abc
produces a binary named
\fBmysqld\-abc\&.exe\fR\&.

.\" make_win_bin_dist: no-debug option
.\" no-debug option: make_win_bin_dist
\fB\-\-no\-debug\fR
.sp
Do not pack the debug binaries even if they were built\&.
.RE

.\" only-debug option: make_win_bin_dist
\fB\-\-only\-debug\fR

Use this option when the target for this build was
Debug, and you just want to replace the normal binaries with debug versions (that is, do not use separate
debug
directories)\&.
