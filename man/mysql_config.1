If you invoke
\fBmysql_config\fR
with no options, it displays a list of all options that it supports, and their values:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_config\fR
Usage: /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config [options]
Options:
  \-\-cflags         [\-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql \-mcpu=pentiumpro]
  \-\-include        [\-I/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql]
  \-\-libs           [\-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql \-lmysqlclient \-lz
                    \-lcrypt \-lnsl \-lm \-L/usr/lib \-lssl \-lcrypto]
  \-\-libs_r         [\-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql \-lmysqlclient_r
                    \-lpthread \-lz \-lcrypt \-lnsl \-lm \-lpthread]
  \-\-socket         [/tmp/mysql.sock]
  \-\-port           [3306]
  \-\-version        [4.0.16]
  \-\-libmysqld\-libs [\-L/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql \-lmysqld \-lpthread \-lz
                    \-lcrypt \-lnsl \-lm \-lpthread \-lrt]

You can use
\fBmysql_config\fR
within a command line to include the value that it displays for a particular option. For example, to compile a MySQL client program, use
\fBmysql_config\fR
as follows:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBCFG=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config\fR
shell> \fBsh \-c "gcc \-o progname `$CFG \-\-include` progname.c `$CFG \-\-libs`"\fR
.fi

.PP
When you use
\fBmysql_config\fR
this way, be sure to invoke it within backtick (\(lq`\(rq) characters. That tells the shell to execute it and substitute its output into the surrounding command.
