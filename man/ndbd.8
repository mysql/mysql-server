\fBndbd\fR
is the process that is used to handle all the data in tables using the NDB Cluster storage engine\&. This is the process that empowers a data node to accomplish distributed transaction handling, node recovery, checkpointing to disk, online backup, and related tasks\&.
.PP
In a MySQL Cluster, a set of
\fBndbd\fR
processes cooperate in handling data\&. These processes can execute on the same computer (host) or on different computers\&. The correspondences between data nodes and Cluster hosts is completely configurable\&.

This option takes a list of data nodes which for which the cluster will not wait for before starting\&.
.sp
This can be used to start the cluster in a partitioned state\&. For example, to start the cluster with only half of the data nodes (nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5) running in a 4\-node cluster, you can start each
\fBndbd\fR
process with
\fB\-\-nowait\-nodes=3,5\fR\&. In this case, the cluster starts as soon as nodes 2 and 4 connect, and does

wait

\(em say, for example, that the host machine for node 3 has suffered a hardware failure \(em then start nodes 2, 4, and 5 with

.PP
When
\fBndbd\fR
starts, it actually initiates two processes\&. The first of these is called the
\(lqangel process\(rq; its only job is to discover when the execution process has been completed, and then to restart the
\fBndbd\fR
process if it is configured to do so\&. Thus, if you attempt to kill
\fBndbd\fR
via the Unix
\fBkill\fR
command, it is necessary to kill both processes, beginning with the angel process\&. The preferred method of terminating an
\fBndbd\fR
process is to use the management client and stop the process from there\&.
.PP
The execution process uses one thread for reading, writing, and scanning data, as well as all other activities\&. This thread is implemented asynchronously so that it can easily handle thousands of concurrent actions\&. In addition, a watch\-dog thread supervises the execution thread to make sure that it does not hang in an endless loop\&. A pool of threads handles file I/O, with each thread able to handle one open file\&. Threads can also be used for transporter connections by the transporters in the
\fBndbd\fR
process\&. In a multi\-processor system performing a large number of operations (including updates), the
\fBndbd\fR
process can consume up to 2 CPUs if permitted to do so\&.
.PP
For a machine with many CPUs it is possible to use several
\fBndbd\fR
processes which belong to different node groups; however, such a configuration is still considered experimental and is not supported for MySQL 5\&.1 in a production setting\&. See
Section\ \&17.1.5, \(lqKnown Limitations of MySQL Cluster\(rq\&.
