.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysql_find_rows\fR
reads files containing SQL statements and extracts statements that match a given regular expression or that contain
USE \fIdb_name\fR
or
SET
statements. The utility was written for use with update log files (as used prior to MySQL 5.0) and as such expects statements to be terminated with semicolon (;) characters. It may be useful with other files that contain SQL statements as long as statements are terminated with semicolons.
