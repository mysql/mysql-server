\fBmysql_setpermission [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysql_setpermission\fR
is a Perl script that was originally written and contributed by Luuk de Boer. It interactively sets permissions in the MySQL grant tables.
\fBmysql_setpermission\fR
is written in Perl and requires that the
DBI
and
DBD::mysql
Perl modules be installed (see
Section\ 2.15, \(lqPerl Installation Notes\(rq).
.PP
Invoke
\fBmysql_setpermission\fR
like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_setpermission [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fIoptions\fR
should be either
\fB\-\-help\fR
to display the help message, or options that indicate how to connect to the MySQL server. The account used when you connect determines which permissions you have when attempting to modify existing permissions in the grant tables.
.PP
\fBmysql_setpermissions\fR
also reads options from the
[client]
and
[perl]
groups in the
\fI.my.cnf\fR
file in your home directory, if the file exists.
.PP
\fBmysql_setpermission\fR
understands the following options:
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-help\fR
.sp
Display a help message and exit.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-host=\fR\fB\fIhost_name\fR\fR
.sp
Connect to the MySQL server on the given host.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-password=\fR\fB\fIpassword\fR\fR
.sp
The password to use when connecting to the server. Note that the password value is not optional for this option, unlike for other MySQL programs. You can use an option file to avoid giving the password on the command line.
.sp
Specifying a password on the command line should be considered insecure. See
Section\ 5.5.6.2, \(lqEnd\-User Guidelines for Password Security\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-port=\fR\fB\fIport_num\fR\fR
.sp
The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-socket=\fR\fB\fIpath\fR\fR
.sp
For connections to
localhost, the Unix socket file to use.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-user=\fR\fB\fIuser_name\fR\fR
.sp
The MySQL user name to use when connecting to the server.
