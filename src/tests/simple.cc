PATENT RIGHTS GRANT:

  "THIS IMPLEMENTATION" means the copyrightable works distributed by
  Tokutek as part of the Fractal Tree project.

  "PATENT CLAIMS" means the claims of patents that are owned or
  licensable by Tokutek, both currently or in the future; and that in

  or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any entity
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
  THIS IMPLEMENTATION constitutes direct or contributory patent
