  CLAIMS.  This grant does not include claims that would be infringed
  only as a consequence of further modifications of THIS
  IMPLEMENTATION.  If you or your agent or licensee institute or order

// This test is a form of stress that does operations on a single dictionary:
// We create a dictionary bigger than the cachetable (around 4x greater).
// Then, we spawn a bunch of pthreads that do the following:
//  - scan dictionary forward with bulk fetch
//  - scan dictionary forward slowly
//  - scan dictionary backward with bulk fetch
//  - scan dictionary backward slowly
//  - Grow the dictionary with insertions
//  - do random point queries into the dictionary
// With the small cachetable, this should produce quite a bit of churn in reading in and evicting nodes.
// If the test runs to completion without crashing, we consider it a success. It also tests that snapshots
// work correctly by verifying that table scans sum their vals to 0.
//
// This does NOT test:
//  - splits and merges
//  - multiple DBs
//
// Variables that are interesting to tweak and run:
//  - small cachetable
//  - number of elements
