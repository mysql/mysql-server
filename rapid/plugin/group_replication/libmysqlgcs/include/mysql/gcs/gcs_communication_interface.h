/**
  @class Gcs_communication_interface

  This interface represents all the communication facilities that a binding
  implementation should provide. Like all interfaces in this API, it is
  group-oriented, meaning that a single instance shall exist per group,
  as it was returned by the class Gcs_interface::get_communication_session.

  It has two major subsections:
  - Message sending: represented by the method send_message, it will
    broadcast a message to the group in which this interface is bound.
    All message data is encapsulated in the Gcs_message object that
    contains more detail about the information to be sent.
    Guarantees are bound to the binding implementation. This means that the
    implementation shall send message of this message and shall not be
    maintained between different groups.

  - Message receiving: Due to the asynchronous nature of this interface,
    message reception is done via an event. They shall be delivered in
    form of callbacks defined in Gcs_communication_event_listener class,
    that should be implemented by a client of this interface interested
    in receiving those notifications.

  A typical usage for this interface would be:

  @code{.cpp}
  class my_Gcs_communication_event_listener: Gcs_communication_event_listener
  {
    void on_message_received(const Gcs_message &message)
    {
      //Do something when message arrives...
    }
  }

  //meanwhile in your client code...
  Gcs_communication_interface *gcs_comm_interface_instance; // obtained
                                                            // previously

  Gcs_communication_event_listener listener_instance;

  int ref_handler=
    gcs_comm_interface_instance->add_event_listener(listener_instance);

  Gcs_message *msg= new Gcs_message(<message_params>);

  gcs_comm_interface_instance->send_message(msg);

  //Normal program flow...

  //In the end...
  gcs_comm_interface_instance->remove_event_listener(ref_handler);

  @endcode
