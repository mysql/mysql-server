/**
  @class Gcs_message

  Class that represents the data that is exchanged within a group. It is sent
  by a member having the group as destination. It shall be received by all
  members that pertain to the group in that moment.

  It is built using two major blocks: the header and the payload of the
  message. A user of Gcs_message can freely add data to the header and to the
  payload.

  Each binding implementation might use these two fields at its own
  discretion but that data should be removed from the header/payload
  before its delivery to the client layer.

  When the message is built, none of the data is passed unto it. One has to
  use the append_* methods in order to append data. Calling encode() at the end
  will provide a ready-to-send message.

  On the receiver side, one shall use decode() in order to have the header and
  the payload restored in the original message fields.

  A typical use case of sending a message is:

  @code{.cpp}

  Gcs_control_interface       *gcs_ctrl_interface_instance;
  Gcs_communication_interface *gcs_comm_interface_instance; // obtained
                                                            // previously

  Gcs_member_identifier *myself=
    gcs_ctrl_interface_instance->get_local_information();

  Gcs_group_identifier destination("the_group");

  Gcs_message *msg= new Gcs_message(&myself, new Gcs_message_data(0, 3));

  uchar[] some_data= {(uchar)0x12,
                      (uchar)0x24,
                      (uchar)0x00};

  msg->get_message_data()->append_to_payload(&some_data,
                                             strlen(some_data));

  gcs_comm_interface_instance->send_message(msg);
  @endcode

  A typical use case of receiving a message is:

  @code{.cpp}
  class my_Gcs_communication_event_listener : Gcs_communication_event_listener
  {
    my_Gcs_communication_event_listener(my_Message_delegator *delegator)
    {
      this->delegator= delegator;
    }

    void on_message_received(Gcs_message &message)
    {
      // Do something when message arrives...
      delegator->process_gcs_message(message);
    }
