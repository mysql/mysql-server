 This is a stage in the pipeline that processes messages when they are
 put through the send and receive code paths.

 A stage may apply a transformation to the payload of the message that it is
 handling. If it does morph the message, it will append a stage header to
 the message and change the payload accordingly. On the receiving side the
 GCS receiver thread will revert the transformation before delivering the
 message to the application.

 An example of a stage is the LZ4 stage that compresses the payload.
