=*= MySQL Group Replication =*=
===============================

The multi master plugin for MySQL is here. MySQL Group Replication enables
virtual synchronous updates on any member in a group of MySQL servers, with
conflict handling and failure detection. Distributed recovery is also in the
package to ease the process of adding new servers to your group.


* == Pre requisites == *

Under the hood, the plugin is powered by group communication protocols.
They run a failure detection and membership service, safe and totally
ordered message delivery. All these services are key to make sure that data
is consistently replicated across a group of servers. At the core, there is
an implementation of Paxos (code named XCom) which acts as the group
communication system engine.


* == Plugin install == *

Please check http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/installing.html


* == Plugin's required configurations  == *

As any new feature, the Group Replication plugin includes some limitations and
requirements that emerge from its underlying characteristics. When configuring
a server and your data for multi master you will need:

1) Have the binlog active and its logging format set to ROW.

   Like on standard replication, multi master replication is based on the
   transmission of log events. Its inner mechanism are however based on the
   write sets generated during row based logging so row based replication is a
   requirement.

   Server options:
     -–log-bin
     --binlog-format=row

2) Have GTIDs enabled.
   MySQL Group Replication depends on GTIDs, used to identify what
   transactions were executed in the group, and for that reason vital to the
   distributed recovery process.

   Server options:
     --gtid-mode=on
     --enforce-gtid-consistency
     --log-slave-updates

3) Use the InnoDB engine.
   Synchronous multi master is dependent on transactional tables so only
   InnoDB is supported. Since this is now the default engine, you only have to
   be careful when creating individual tables.

4) Every table must have a primary key.
   Multi master concurrency control is based on primary keys. Every change
   made to a table line is indexed to its primary key so this is a fundamental
   requirement.

5) Table based repositories
   The relay log info and master info repositories must have their type set to
   TABLE. Since group replication relies on channels for its applier and
   recovery mechanism, table repositories are needed to isolate their
   execution info.

   Server options:
     --master-info-repository=TABLE
     --relay-log-info-repository=TABLE

6) Set the transaction write set extraction algorithm
   The process of extracting what writes were made during a transaction is
   crucial for conflict detection on all group servers. This extracted
   information is then hashed using a specified algorithm that must be chosen
   upfront. Currently there are two available algorithms: XXHASH64 and
   MURMUR32.

   Server options:
     --transaction-write-set-extraction=XXHASH64

 7) GCS engine
    The GCS module relies on an implementation of Paxos developed at Oracle
    (codename: XCom) as the building block to provide distributed agreement
    between servers.

    To configure the GCS engine there are four options, described here:

    group_replication_local_address
    -------------------------------
    The member local address, i.e., host:port that member will expose
    itself to be contacted by the group.
    Default value: empty string.

    group_replication_group_seeds
    --------------------------------
    The list of peers, comma separated. E.g., host1:port1,host2:port2,
    that also belong to the group.
    If the server is not configured to bootstrap a group it will
    sequentially contact the peers in the group in order to be added or
    removed from it.
    If the list contains its member local address, it will be ignored.
    Default value: empty string.

    group_replication_bootstrap_group
    ---------------------------------
    If set to true, the server will bootstrap the group.
    group_replication_group_seeds has no effect if this option is set
    to true.
    Default value: False.

    ==> Sample configuration for a 3 member group

    We are using global variables, but the configuration can be set on
    configuration files.

    Server 1:
    > SET GLOBAL group_replication_group_name= "UUID";
    > SET GLOBAL group_replication_local_address="192.168.0.1:10300";
    > SET GLOBAL group_replication_group_seeds= \
      "192.168.0.1:10300,192.168.0.2:10300,192.168.0.3:10300";
    > SET GLOBAL group_replication_bootstrap_group= 1;

    Server 2:
    > SET GLOBAL group_replication_group_name= "UUID";
    > SET GLOBAL group_replication_local_address="192.168.0.2:10300";
    > SET GLOBAL group_replication_group_seeds= \
      "192.168.0.1:10300,192.168.0.2:10300,192.168.0.3:10300";

    Server 3:
    > SET GLOBAL group_replication_group_name= "UUID";
    > SET GLOBAL group_replication_local_address="192.168.0.3:10300";
    > SET GLOBAL group_replication_group_seeds= \
      "192.168.0.1:10300,192.168.0.2:10300,192.168.0.3:10300";

    The group member join order must be:
     1) server 1 (the one with group_replication_bootstrap_group= 1);
     2) all others.

    After server 1 bootstraps the group, its
    group_replication_bootstrap_group must be set to 0, in order to it to
    be able to leave and rejoin, if needed, the *same* group instead of
    starting a new one.


Other current limitations:

1) Binlog Event checksum use must be OFF.
   Due to needed changes in the checksum mechanism, multi master is
   incompatible with these features as of now.

   Server options:
     --binlog-checksum=NONE

2) No concurrent DDL
   As of now, DDL statements can't be concurrently executed with other DDL
   queries or even DML.

* == Hands on with MySQL Group Replication == *

First of all, set-up a group of servers using the provided binaries that come
with the release or compile them yourself following the generic MySQL
compilation instructions.

To test this on you desktop, use a group of physical or virtual machines, the
only requirement is that all your machines are network reachable. In this
example, three machines are spawn from the same machine with different data
folders.


==> Start the servers with the plugin and all the necessary options

Server 1

  $ ./bin/mysqld --no-defaults --basedir=. --datadir=data01 -P 13001 \
    --socket=mysqld1.sock --log-bin=master-bin --server-id=1         \
    --gtid-mode=on --enforce-gtid-consistency --log-slave-updates    \
    --binlog-checksum=NONE --binlog-format=row                       \
    --master-info-repository=TABLE --relay-log-info-repository=TABLE \
    --transaction-write-set-extraction=XXHASH64                      \
    --plugin-dir=lib/plugin --plugin-load=group_replication.so

Server 2

  $ ./bin/mysqld --no-defaults --basedir=. --datadir=data02 -P 13002 \
    --socket=mysqld2.sock --log-bin=master-bin --server-id=2         \
    --gtid-mode=on --enforce-gtid-consistency --log-slave-updates    \
    --binlog-checksum=NONE --binlog-format=row                       \
    --master-info-repository=TABLE --relay-log-info-repository=TABLE \
    --transaction-write-set-extraction=XXHASH64                      \
    --plugin-dir=lib/plugin --plugin-load=group_replication.so

Server 3

  $ ./bin/mysqld --no-defaults --basedir=. --datadir=data03 -P 13003 \
    --socket=mysqld3.sock --log-bin=master-bin --server-id=3         \
    --gtid-mode=on --enforce-gtid-consistency --log-slave-updates    \
    --binlog-checksum=NONE --binlog-format=row                       \
    --master-info-repository=TABLE --relay-log-info-repository=TABLE \
    --transaction-write-set-extraction=XXHASH64                      \
    --plugin-dir=lib/plugin --plugin-load=group_replication.so

On Windows systems the plugin filename is group_replication.dll

Alternatively, if you have a running server without the plugin loaded
you can install it on run-time. This implies that you have GTID mode
ON, row based logging and all the above requirements correctly
configured.

  $ ./bin/mysql -uroot -h 127.0.0.1 -P 13001 --prompt='server1>'

  server1> INSTALL PLUGIN group_replication SONAME 'group_replication.so';

On Windows systems the plugin filename is group_replication.dll


=> Create a replication user

Needed for inter member connections, as described below, all group servers
should have a valid replication user.

  server> CREATE USER rpl_user@'%';
  server> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO rpl_user@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'rpl_pass';
  server> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


==> Configure it

The first step on configuring a MySQL Group server is to define a
unique name that identifies the group and allows its members to join.
This name must be defined on every member, and since it works also as the
group UUID, it must be a valid UUID.

  server1> SET GLOBAL group_replication_group_name= "8a94f357-aab4-11df-86ab-c80aa9429562";

Besides this, you should also configure the access credentials for recovery.
These settings are used by joining servers to establish a slave connection to a
donor when entering the group, allowing them to receive missing data. Ignored
on the first member that forms the group, you should always configure it on
every server anyway, as they may fail and be reinstated at any moment in time.

By default the configured value of the user and password to be used for
connecting to the donor is empty i.e. "". To change the values you need to
execute CHANGE MASTER FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery' which will
not only create the recovery channel to connect to the donor but will also set
the username and password value to be used.

  server1> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_USER='rpl_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='rpl_pass' FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';

Please note: You can only set the username and password value for the
group_replication_recovery channel. Any other valid CHANGE MASTER parameter
set for this channel will return an error.

Most of this channel parameters are automatically configured by the recovery
process, so you can never define to which server a joiner shall connect for
example. You can however use the recovery’s retry count and reconnect interval
variables. These field tells recovery how many times it should try to connect
to the available donors and how much time to wait when every attempt to connect
to all group donors fails. By default, retry count is equal to 10 and the
reconnect interval is set to 60 seconds.

If you want to modify them, just use a variation of the example commands:

  server1> SET GLOBAL group_replication_recovery_retry_count= 2;

  server1> SET GLOBAL group_replication_recovery_reconnect_interval= 120;

Configure group communication settings:
  server1> SET GLOBAL group_replication_local_address="127.0.0.1:10301";
  server1> SET GLOBAL group_replication_group_seeds= \
           "127.0.0.1:10301,127.0.0.1:10302,127.0.0.1:10303";
  server1> SET GLOBAL group_replication_bootstrap_group= 1;

==> Start multi master replication

  server1> START GROUP_REPLICATION;
  server1> SET GLOBAL group_replication_bootstrap_group= 0;

==> Check the server status

 server1> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.replication_connection_status\G
 *************************** 1. row ***************************
              CHANNEL_NAME: group_replication_applier
                GROUP_NAME: 8a94f357-aab4-11df-86ab-c80aa9429562
               SOURCE_UUID: 8a94f357-aab4-11df-86ab-c80aa9429562
                 THREAD_ID: NULL
             SERVICE_STATE: ON
 COUNT_RECEIVED_HEARTBEATS: 0
  LAST_HEARTBEAT_TIMESTAMP: 0000-00-00 00:00:00
  RECEIVED_TRANSACTION_SET: 8a94f357-aab4-11df-86ab-c80aa9429562:1
         LAST_ERROR_NUMBER: 0
        LAST_ERROR_MESSAGE:
      LAST_ERROR_TIMESTAMP: 0000-00-00 00:00:00

Here you can see the information about group replication through the status of
its main channel. Besides the name you know the group replication applier is
running and that no error was detected.


==> Check the group members

  server1> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.replication_group_members;
  +---------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
  | CHANNEL_NAME              | MEMBER_ID                            | MEMBER_HOST   | MEMBER_PORT | MEMBER_STATE |

  +---------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+


==> Test query execution

Start server 2:

  server2> SET GLOBAL group_replication_group_name= "8a94f357-aab4-11df-86ab-c80aa9429562";
  server2> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_USER='rpl_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='rpl_pass' FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';

  +---------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+

Insert some data on server 1:

  server1> CREATE DATABASE test;
  server1> CREATE TABLE test.t1 (c1 INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY) ENGINE=InnoDB;
  server1> INSERT INTO test.t1 VALUES (1);


Alternate between servers and check the data flow:

  server2> SELECT * FROM test.t1;
  +----+
  | c1 |
  +----+
  |  1 |
  +----+

  server2> INSERT INTO test.t1 VALUES (2);

  server1> SELECT * FROM test.t1;
  +----+
  | c1 |
  +----+
  |  1 |
  |  2 |
  +----+


==> See distributed recovery in action

When you start a new server, it will try to get all the data it is missing from
the other group members. It will use the configured access credentials and
connect to another member fetching the missing group transactions.
During this period its state will be shown as 'RECOVERING', and you should not
preform any action on this server during this phase.


  server3> SET GLOBAL group_replication_group_name= "8a94f357-aab4-11df-86ab-c80aa9429562";
  server3> CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_USER='rpl_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='rpl_pass' FOR CHANNEL 'group_replication_recovery';
  server3> SET GLOBAL group_replication_local_address="127.0.0.1:10303";
  server3> SET GLOBAL group_replication_group_seeds= \
           "127.0.0.1:10301,127.0.0.1:10302,127.0.0.1:10303";
  server3> START GROUP_REPLICATION;

  server3> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.replication_group_members;

  +---------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+

Wait for it to be online. Truth is that here, with such a small
amount of data, this state is hard to spot. However, you should be
aware of this when dealing with real data sets.

  server3> SELECT * FROM performance_schema.replication_group_members;

  server3> SELECT * FROM test.t1;
  +----+
  | c1 |
  +----+
  |  1 |
  |  2 |
  +----+


==> Be aware of failures on concurrency scenarios

Due to the distributed nature of MySQL group replication, concurrent updates
can result on query failure if the queries are found to be conflicting. Lets
perform a concurrent update to the same line in the example table

On server 1

  server1> UPDATE test.t1 SET c1=4 where c1=1;

On server 2

  server2> UPDATE test.t1 SET c1=3 where c1=1;

Execute in parallel

  server1> UPDATE test.t1 SET c1=4 where c1=1;
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.06 sec)

  server2> UPDATE test.t1 SET c1=3 where c1=1;
  ERROR 1181 (HY000): Got error 149 during ROLLBACK

Note that the scenario where the second update succeeds and the first one
fails is also equally possible and only depends on the order the queries were
ordered and certified inside the plugin.

Let's check the tables.

server1> SELECT * FROM test.t1;
+----+
| c1 |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |
+----+

server2> SELECT * FROM test.t1;
+----+
| c1 |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |
+----+

The failed query rollbacks and no server data is affected by it.


==> Check the execution stats

Check your GTID stats on each group member

  server1>SELECT @@GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED;
  +------------------------------------------+
  | @@GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED                   |
  +------------------------------------------+
  | 8a94f357-aab4-11df-86ab-c80aa9429562:1-8 |
  +------------------------------------------+

  server2>SELECT @@GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED;
  +------------------------------------------+
  | @@GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED                   |
  +------------------------------------------+
  | 8a94f357-aab4-11df-86ab-c80aa9429562:1-8 |
  +------------------------------------------+

Note that in all servers the GTID executed set is the same and belongs to the
group.
You are maybe asking yourself why the set contains 8 transactions when we only
executed 5 successful queries in this tutorial. The reason is that whenever a
member joins or leaves the group a transaction is logged to mark in every member
this moment for recovery reasons.

The member execution stats are also available on the performance schema
tables.

  SELECT * FROM performance_schema.replication_group_member_stats\G
  *************************** 1. row ***************************
                        CHANNEL_NAME: group_replication_applier
                             VIEW_ID: 1425918173:3
                           MEMBER_ID: e221c36c-c652-11e4-956d-6067203feba0
         COUNT_TRANSACTIONS_IN_QUEUE: 0
          COUNT_TRANSACTIONS_CHECKED: 6
            COUNT_CONFLICTS_DETECTED: 1
       COUNT_TRANSACTIONS_VALIDATING: 0
  TRANSACTIONS_COMMITTED_ALL_MEMBERS: 8a94f357-aab4-11df-86ab-c80aa9429562:1-8
      LAST_CONFLICT_FREE_TRANSACTION: 8a94f357-aab4-11df-86ab-c80aa9429562:8


Where it can be seen that, from the 6 executed queries on this tutorial, 1 was
found to be conflicting. We can also see that the transaction in the queue are
0, so it means no transaction are waiting validation.

On the last fields, the transaction validating field is 0 because all
transaction that were executed are already considered to be stable on all
members, as seen in the second last field. In other words, every member knows
all the data, so the number of possible conflicting transactions is 0.


==> Stop group replication

To stop the plugin, you just need to execute:

  server1> STOP GROUP_REPLICATION;


==> Reset group replication channels

If after using group replication you want to remove the associated channel and
files you can execute.

  server1> RESET SLAVE ALL FOR CHANNEL "group_replication_applier";

Note that the "group_replication_applier" channel is not a normal slave
channel and will not respond to generic commands like "RESET SLAVE ALL".


==> How to start multi master replication at server boot

Before configuring Group replication to start on boot, please remember that at
least once, you need to configure the recovery access credentials.
To allow the member to contact other servers, you must at least once start the
server and execute a CHANGE MASTER command for group_replication_recovery channel
with the values being set for MASTER_USER and MASTER_PASSWORD. On subsequent
restarts on these members there is no need to run CHANGE MASTER command again
since its values are persisted.

From this point on Group Replication can now start along side with the server
given that you configure the below options:

Set the group name

  --loose-group_replication_group_name

Set the start on boot flag to true

  --loose-group_replication_start_on_boot

When using XCom you will also need the contact options.

--loose-group_replication_local_address="127.0.0.1:10301";
--loose-group_replication_group_seeds= "127.0.0.1:10301,127.0.0.1:10302,127.0.0.1:10303";

* == Conclusion == *

On his first steps, MySQL Group Replication is still in development. Feel free
to try it and get back at us so we can make it even better for the community!
