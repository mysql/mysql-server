# This test intends to prove that group replication channels are not affected
# by START SLAVE and STOP SLAVE commands.
#
# Test:
# 0) The test requires three servers: M1 and M2.
# 1) Bootstrap start a group on M1. Start GR on M2.
# 2) Create a slave channel 'channel_1' on M1 (M3 -> M1). Verify that both slave
#    channel and group_replication_applier channel are present on M1.
# 3) With a running slave channel and group replication active do a STOP SLAVE.
#    The slave channel should stop but the group replication channel shouldn't.
# 4) With a stopped slave channel and group replication off do a START SLAVE.
#    The slave channel should start but the group replication channel shouldn't.
# 5) Restart the server with no automatic plugin start.
#    The slave channel should start but the group replication channel shouldn't.
# 6) Clean up.
