/*
  This version script is heavily inspired  by Fedora's and Mageia's version
  scripts for MySQL client shared library.
  But it was modified to support Debian-compatible versioning too.

  In RedHat universe, symbols from old libmysqlclient.so.16
  keep their libmysqlclient_16 version. New symbols added in
  libmysqlclient.so.18 get the new libmysqlclient_18 version.

  In Debian all symbols in libmysqlclient.so.18 have libmysqlclient_18 version,
  including symbols that existed in libmysqlclient.so.16

  We solve this by putting all symbols into libmysqlclient_18 version node,
  but creating aliases for old symbols in the libmysqlclient_16 version node.
