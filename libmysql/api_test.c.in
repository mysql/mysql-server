  @file

  Application for testing if all C API functions to be exported by the client 
  library (as declared by CLIENT_API_FUNCTIONS in libmysql/CMakeLists.txt) are
  declared by <mysql.h> header and indeed exported.

  This code should fail to compile if some API function is not declared in
  <mysql.h>. Assuming dynamic linking, it should fail to run if some of the
  functions is not exported by the shared library.

  Note: this source is generated during build configuration process from
  template in libmysql/api_test.c.in. Do not edit this file - edit the template
  instead.
