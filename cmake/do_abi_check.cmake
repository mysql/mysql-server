# Rules for checking that the abi/api has not changed.
#
# The following steps are followed in the do_abi_check rule below
#
# 1) Generate preprocessor output for the files that need to
#    be tested for abi/api changes. use -nostdinc to prevent
#    generation of preprocessor output for system headers. This
#    results in messages in stderr saying that these headers
#    were not found. Redirect the stderr output to /dev/null
#    to prevent seeing these messages.
# 2) sed the output to
#    2.1) remove blank lines and lines that begin with "# "
#    2.2) When gcc -E is run on the Mac OS  and solaris sparc platforms it
#         introduces a line of output that shows up as a difference between
#         the .pp and .out files. Remove these OS specific preprocessor text
#         inserted by the preprocessor.
# 3) diff the generated file and the canons (.pp files already in
#    the repository).
# 4) delete the .out file that is generated.
#
# If the diff fails, the generated file is not removed. This will
# be useful for analysis of ABI differences (e.g. using a visual
# diff tool).
#
# A ABI change that causes a build to fail will always be accompanied
# by new canons (.out files). The .out files that are not removed will
# be replaced as the new .pp files.
#
# e.g. If include/mysql/plugin.h has an ABI change then this rule would
# leave a <build directory>/abi_check.out file.
#
# A developer with a justified API change will then do a
# mv <build directory>/abi_check.out include/mysql/plugin.pp
# to replace the old canons with the new ones.
