# As of cmake 3.13 there is a new target_link_options(....) function.
# This adds link options to executables or shared libraries.

# For example, "LINKER:-z,defs" becomes
# for gcc   : -Wl,-z,defs
# for clang : -Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs
# for SunPro: -Qoption ld -z,defs

# This is a home-grown replacement for target_link_options, since
# we need to support older versions of cmake.

# We currently only need -Wl,<comma separated option list>
# so we can simply do STRING_APPEND on the appropriate LINK_FLAGS.
