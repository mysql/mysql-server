# postinstall script for the MySQL Startup Item Installation package
#
# This script modifies /etc/hostconfig in the following ways:
#
# - On Mac OS X Server, it disables the startup of the default MySQL
#   installation by changing the "MYSQL" start variable to "-NO-".
# - If not existent already, it adds a "MYSQLCOM" start variable, which
#   defaults to "-YES-". An already existing MYSQLCOM variable will remain
#   untouched.
