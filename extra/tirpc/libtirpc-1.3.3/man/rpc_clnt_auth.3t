.Nm auth_destroy ,
.Nm authnone_create ,
.Nm authsys_create ,
.Nm authsys_create_default
.Nd library routines for client side remote procedure call authentication
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In rpc/rpc.h
.Ft "void"
.Fn auth_destroy "AUTH *auth"
.Ft "AUTH *"
.Fn authnone_create "void"
.Ft "AUTH *"
.Fn authsys_create "const char *host" "const uid_t uid" "const gid_t gid" "const int len" "const gid_t *aup_gids"
.Ft "AUTH *"
.Fn authsys_create_default "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These routines are part of the
RPC library that allows C language programs to make procedure
calls on other machines across the network,
with desired authentication.
.Pp
These routines are normally called after creating the
.Vt CLIENT
handle.
The
.Va cl_auth
field of the
.Vt CLIENT
structure should be initialized by the
.Vt AUTH
structure returned by some of the following routines.
The client's authentication information
is passed to the server when the
RPC
call is made.
.Pp
Only the
.Dv NULL
and the
.Dv SYS
style of authentication is discussed here.
.Sh Routines
.Bl -tag -width authsys_create_default()
.It Fn auth_destroy
A function macro that destroys the authentication
information associated with
.Fa auth .
Destruction usually involves deallocation
of private data structures.
The use of
.Fa auth
is undefined after calling
.Fn auth_destroy .
.It Fn authnone_create
Create and return an RPC
authentication handle that passes nonusable
authentication information with each remote procedure call.
This is the default authentication used by RPC.
.It Fn authsys_create
Create and return an RPC authentication handle that contains
.Dv AUTH_SYS
authentication information.
The
.Fa host
argument
is the name of the machine on which the information was
created;
.Fa uid
is the user's user ID;
.Fa gid
is the user's current group ID;
.Fa len
and
.Fa aup_gids
refer to a counted array of groups to which the user belongs.
.It Fn authsys_create_default
Call
.Fn authsys_create
with the appropriate arguments.
.El
.Sh AVAILABILITY
These functions are part of libtirpc.
