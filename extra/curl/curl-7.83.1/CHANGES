- gskit: remove unused function set_callback
  
  This function has been unused since the initial commit of the GSKit
  backend in 0eba02fd4.  The motivation for the code was getting the
  whole certificate chain: the only place where the latter is available
  is as a callback parameter.  Unfortunately it is not possible to pass
  a user pointer to this callback, which precludes the possibility to
  associate the cert chain with a data/conn structure.
  
  For further information, search for pgsk_cert_validation_callback on:
  https://www.ibm.com/docs/api/v1/content/ssw_ibm_i_71/apis/gsk_attribute_set_callback.htm
  
  As the upstream library never added a parameter like that to the API,
  we give up the wait and remove the dead code.

- cookies: Improve errorhandling for reading cookiefile
  
  The existing programming had some issues with errorhandling for reading
  the cookie file. If the file failed to open, we would silently ignore it
  and continue as if there was no file (or stdin) passed. In this case, we
  would also call fclose() on the NULL FILE pointer, which is undefined
  behavior. Fix by ensuring that the FILE pointer is set before calling
  fclose on it, and issue a warning in case the file cannot be opened.
  Erroring out on nonexisting file would break backwards compatibility of
  very old behavior so we can't really go there.

  tool_paramhlp: use feof(3) to identify EOF correctly when using fread(3)
  
  This loop was using the number of bytes read from the file as condition
  to keep reading.
  
  From Linux's fread(3) man page:
  > On success, fread() and fwrite() return the number of items read or
  > written. This number equals the number of bytes transferred only when
  > size is 1. If an error occurs, or the end of the file is reached, the
  > return value is a short item count (or zero).
  >
  > The file position indicator for the stream is advanced by the number
  > of bytes successfully read or written.
  >
  > fread() does not distinguish between end-of-file and error, and
  > callers must use feof(3) and ferror(3) to determine which occurred.
  
  This means that nread!=0 doesn't make much sense as an end condition for
  the loop: nread==0 doesn't necessarily mean that EOF has been reached or
  an error has occured (but that is usually the case) and nread!=0 doesn't
  necessarily mean that EOF has not been reached or that no read errors
  have occured. feof(3) and ferror(3) should be uses when using fread(3).
  
  Currently curl has to performs an extra fread(3) call to get a return
  value equal to 0 to stop looping.
  
  This usually "works" (even though nread==0 shouldn't be interpreted as
  EOF) if stdin is a pipe because EOF usually marks the "real" end of the
  stream, so the extra fread(3) call will return immediately and the extra
  read syscall won't be noticeable:
  
      bash-5.1$ strace -e read curl -s -F file=@- 0x0.st <<< a 2>&1 |
      > tail -n 5
      read(0, "a\n", 4096)                    = 2
      read(0, "", 4096)                       = 0
      read(0, "", 4096)                       = 0
      http://0x0.st/oRs.txt
      +++ exited with 0 +++
      bash-5.1$
  
  But this doesn't work if curl is reading from stdin, stdin is a
  terminal, and the EOF is being emulated using a shell with ^D. Two
  consecutive ^D will be required in this case to actually make curl stop
  reading:
  
      bash-5.1$ curl -F file=@- 0x0.st
      a
      ^D^D
      http://0x0.st/oRs.txt
      bash-5.1$
  
  A possible workaround to this issue is to use a program that handles EOF
  correctly to indirectly send data to curl's stdin:
  
      bash-5.1$ cat - | curl -F file=@- 0x0.st
      a
      ^D
      http://0x0.st/oRs.txt
      bash-5.1$
  
  This patch makes curl handle EOF properly when using fread(3) in
  file2memory() so that the workaround is not necessary.
  
  Since curl was previously ignoring read errors caused by this fread(3),
  ferror(3) is also used in the condition of the loop: read errors and EOF

  - Rename VC15 -> VC14.10, VC17 -> VC14.30.
  
  The projects directory that holds the pre-generated Visual Studio
  project files uses VC<ver> to indicate the MSVC version. At some point
  support for Visual Studio 2017 (Visual Studio version 15 which uses MSVC
  14.10) was added as VC15. Visual Studio 2022 (Visual Studio version 17
  which uses MSVC 14.30) project files were recently added and followed
  that same format using VC17.
  
  There is no such MSVC version (yet) as VC15 or VC17.
  
  For VS 2017 for example, the name we use is correct as either VS17,
  VS2017, VC14.10. I opted for the latter since we use VC for earlier
  versions (eg VC10, VC12, etc).

- tool and tests: force flush of all buffers at end of program
  
  On Windows data can be lost in buffers in case of abnormal program
  termination, especially in process chains as seen due to flaky tests.
  Therefore flushing all buffers manually should avoid this data loss.
  
  In the curl tool we play the safe game by only flushing write buffers,
  but in the testsuite where we manage all buffers, we flush everything.
  
  This should drastically reduce Windows CI and testsuite flakiness.

  runtests: make 'oldlibssh' be before 0.9.4
  
  The 'oldlibssh' feature indicates that the error code returned by libssh
  for a broken known_hosts file should be 67 rather than 60 (test1459).
  This feature was added as part of #8444 with 'oldlibssh' mapping to
  libssh versions prior to 0.9.6, and then refined as part of #8511 to map
  to versions prior to 0.9.5.
  
  In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5 there is a patched version of libssh
  version 0.9.4 (https://git.centos.org/rpms/libssh/blob/c8/f/SOURCES) in
  which test1459 fails because it returns the "new" value rather than the
  "old" one. It's plausible that one of the patches is responsible for
  this rather than the underlying code but I don't think so.
  
  This change therefore drops the 'oldlibssh' version check to map to
  libssh versions older than 0.9.4, which fixes builds on RHEL-8.

- openssl: check if sessionid flag is enabled before retrieving session
  
  Ideally, Curl_ssl_getsessionid should not be called unless sessionid
  caching is enabled. There is a debug assertion in the function to help
  ensure that. Therefore, the pattern in all vtls is basically:
  
    if(primary.sessionid) {lock(); Curl_ssl_getsessionid(...); unlock();}
  
  There was one instance in openssl.c where sessionid was not checked
  beforehand and this change fixes that.
  
  Prior to this change an assertion would occur in openssl debug builds
  during connection stage if session caching was disabled.

- multi: allow user callbacks to call curl_multi_assign
  
  Several years ago a change was made to block user callbacks from calling

  blocked was curl_multi_assign. Recently the blocking was extended to the
  multi interface API, however curl_multi_assign may need to be called
  from within those user callbacks (eg CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION).
  
  I can't think of any callback where it would be unsafe to call
  curl_multi_assign so I removed the restriction entirely.

- curl-openssl: fix SRP check for OpenSSL 3.0
  
  When OpenSSL 3.0 is built with `--api=3.0` and `no-deprecated`, the SRP
  functions exist in the library, but are disabled for user code. Check
  if they are actually usable instead of only if they exist. Also, check
  for the functions actually required for TLS-SRP.
  
  TLS-SRP support is still enabled if OpenSSL is configured with just
  `--api=3.0` or with `--api=1.1.1 no-deprecated`.

- md5: refactor for standard compliance
  
  - Wrap OpenSSL / wolfSSL MD5 functions instead of taking their function

  Depending on how curl was built the old way may have used a dllimport
  function address during static initialization, which is not standard
  compliant, resulting in Visual Studio warning C4232 (nonstandard
  extension). Instead the function pointers now point to the wrappers
  which call the MD5 functions.
  
  This change only affects OpenSSL and wolfSSL because calls to other SSL
  libraries' md5 functions were already wrapped. Also sha256.c already
  does this for all SSL libraries.

  ... when a certificate fails to be loaded from a blob
  
  Closes #8266

- curl_multi_socket.3: remove callback and typical usage descriptions
  
  1. The callback is better described in the option for setting it. Having
  it in a single place reduces the risk that one of them is wrong.
  
  2. The "typical usage" is wrong since the functions described in this
  man page are both deprecated so they cannot be used in any "typical" way
  anymore.

  rustls: add CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB support
  
  Add support for `CURLOPT_CAINFO_BLOB` `CURLOPT_PROXY_CAINFO_BLOB` to the
  rustls TLS backend. Multiple certificates in a single PEM string are
  supported just like OpenSSL does with this option.
  
  This is compatible at least with rustls-ffi 0.8+ which is our new
  minimum version anyway.
  
  I was able to build and run this on Windows, pulling trusted certs from
  the system and then add them to rustls by setting

  point out a specific position within the URL for the problem, this now
  instead introduces a number of additional and more fine-grained error
  codes to allow the API to return more exactly in what "part" or section
  of the URL a problem was detected.
  
  Also bug-fixes curl_url_get() with CURLUPART_ZONEID, which previously
  returned CURLUE_OK even if no zoneid existed.

  rustls: read of zero bytes might be okay
  
  When we're reading out plaintext from rustls' internal buffers, we might
  get a read of zero bytes (meaning a clean TCP close, including
  close_notify). However, we shouldn't return immediately when that
  happens, since we may have already copied out some plaintext bytes.
  Break out of the loop when we get a read of zero bytes, and figure out
  which path we're dealing with.

  rustls: remove incorrect EOF check
  
  The update to rustls-ffi 0.8.0 changed handling of EOF and close_notify.
  From the CHANGELOG:
  
  > Handling of unclean close and the close_notify TLS alert. Mirroring
  > upstream changes, a rustls_connection now tracks TCP closed state like
  > so: rustls_connection_read_tls considers a 0-length read from its
  > callback to mean "TCP stream was closed by peer."  If that happens
  > before the peer sent close_notify, rustls_connection_read will return
  > RUSTLS_RESULT_UNEXPECTED_EOF once the available plaintext bytes are
  > exhausted. This is useful to protect against truncation attacks. Note:
  > some TLS implementations don't send close_notify. If you are already
  > getting length information from your protocol (e.g. Content-Length in
  > HTTP) you may choose to ignore UNEXPECTED_EOF so long as the number of
  > plaintext bytes was as expected.
  
  That means we don't need to check for unclean EOF in `cr_recv()`,
  because `process_new_packets()` will give us an error if appropriate.

  configure: don't enable TLS when --without-* flags are used
  
  Previously specifying `--without-gnutls` would unexpectedly attempt to
  compile with GnuTLS, effectively interpreting this as
  `--with-gnutls`. This caused a significant amount of confusion when
  `libcurl` was built with SSL disabled since GnuTLS wasn't present.
  
  68d89f24 dropped the `--without-*` options from the configure help, but
  `AC_ARG_WITH` still defines these flags automatically. As
  https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.60/html_node/External-Software.html
  describes, the `action-if-given` is called when the user specifies
  `--with-*` or `--without-*` options.
  
  To prevent this confusion, we make the `--without` flag do the right
  thing by ignoring the value if it set to "no".

  In a serial transfer setup, if no transfer at all is done due to them
  all being skipped because of this error, curl will output an error
  message and return exit code 26.

  sendf: accept zero-length data in Curl_client_write()
  
  Historically, Curl_client_write() used a length value of 0 as a marker
  for a null-terminated data string. This feature has been removed in
  commit f4b85d2. To detect leftover uses of the feature, a DEBUGASSERT
  statement rejecting a length with value 0 was introduced, effectively
  precluding use of this function with zero-length data.
  
  The current commit removes the DEBUGASSERT and makes the function to
  return immediately if length is 0.
  
  A direct effect is to fix trying to output a zero-length distinguished
  name in openldap.
  
  Another DEBUGASSERT statement is also rephrased for better readability.

- http: set content length earlier
  
  - Make content length (ie download size) accessible to the user in the
    header callback, but only after all headers have been processed (ie
    only in the final call to the header callback).
  
  Background:
  
  For a long time the content length could be retrieved in the header
  callback via CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD_T as soon as it was parsed
  by curl.
  
  Changes were made in 8a16e54 (precedes 7.79.0) to ignore content length
  if any transfer encoding is used. A side effect of that was that
  content length was not set by libcurl until after the header callback
  was called the final time, because until all headers are processed it
  cannot be determined if content length is valid.
  
  This change keeps the same intention --all headers must be processed--
  but now the content length is available before the final call to the
  header function that indicates all headers have been processed (ie
  a blank header).

- version_win32: use actual version instead of manifested version
  
  - Use RtlVerifyVersionInfo instead of VerifyVersionInfo, when possible.
  
  Later versions of Windows have normal version functions that compare and
  return versions based on the way the application is manifested, instead
  of the actual version of Windows the application is running on. We
  prefer the actual version of Windows so we'll now call the Rtl variant
  of version functions (RtlVerifyVersionInfo) which does a proper
  comparison of the actual version.

  hostip: Move allocation to clarify there is no memleak
  
  By just glancing at the code, it looks like there is a memleak if the
  call to Curl_inet_pton() fails. Looking closer, it is clear that the
  call to Curl_inet_pton() can not fail, so the code will never leak

- lib: avoid fallthrough cases in switch statements
  
  Commit b5a434f7f0ee4d64857f8592eced5b9007d83620 inhibits the warning
  on implicit fallthrough cases, since the current coding of indicating
  fallthrough with comments is falling out of fashion with new compilers.
  This attempts to make the issue smaller by rewriting fallthroughs to no
  longer fallthrough, via either breaking the cases or turning switch
  statements into if statements.
  
    lib/content_encoding.c: the fallthrough codepath is simply copied
      into the case as it's a single line.
    lib/http_ntlm.c: the fallthrough case skips a state in the state-
      machine and fast-forwards to NTLMSTATE_LAST. Do this before the
      switch statement instead to set up the states that we actually
      want.
    lib/http_proxy.c: the fallthrough is just falling into exiting the
      switch statement which can be done easily enough in the case.
    lib/mime.c: switch statement rewritten as if statement.
    lib/pop3.c: the fallthrough case skips to the next state in the
      statemachine, do this explicitly instead.
    lib/urlapi.c: switch statement rewritten as if statement.
    lib/vssh/wolfssh.c: the fallthrough cases fast-forwards the state
      machine, do this by running another iteration of the switch
      statement instead.
    lib/vtls/gtls.c: switch statement rewritten as if statement.
    lib/vtls/nss.c: the fallthrough codepath is simply copied into the
      case as it's a single line. Also twiddle a comment to not be
      inside a non-brace if statement.

- curl.1: remove mentions of really old version changes
  
  To make the man page more readable, this change removes all references
  to changes in support/versions etc that happened before 7.30.0 from the
  curl.1 output file. 7.30.0 was released on Apr 12 2013. This particular
  limit is a bit arbitrary but was fairly easy to grep for.
  
  It is handled like this: the 'Added' keyword is only used in output if
  it refers to 7.30.0 or later. All occurances of "(Added in $VERSION)" in
  description will be stripped out if the mentioned $VERSION is from
  before 7.30.0. It is therefore important that the "Added in..."
  references are always written exactly like that - and on a single line,
  not split over two.
  
  This change removes about 80 version number references from curl.1, down
  to 138 from 218.

  On connection shutdown, a new TLS session ticket may arrive after the
  SSL session cache has already been destructed. In this case, the new
  SSL session cannot be added to the SSL session cache.
  
  The callers of Curl_ssl_addsessionid() need to know whether the SSL
  session has been added to the cache. If it has not been added, the
  reference counter of the SSL session must not be incremented, or memory
  used by the SSL session must be freed. This is now possible with the new

- http2: Curl_http2_setup needs to init stream data in all invokes
  
  Thus function was written to avoid doing multiple connection data
  initializations, which is fine, but since it also initiates stream
  related data it is crucial that it doesn't skip those even if called
  again for the same connection. Solved by moving the stream
  initializations before the "doing-it-again" check.

- runtests: add option -u to error on server unexpectedly alive
  
  Let's try to actually handle the server unexpectedly alive
  case by first making them visible on CI builds as failures.
  
  This is needed to detect issues with killing of the test
  servers completely including nested process chains with
  multiple PIDs per test server (including bash and perl).
  
  On Windows/cygwin platforms this is especially helpful with
  debugging PID mixups due to cygwin using its own PID space.

- cirrus: Add FreeBSD 13.0 job and disable sanitizer build

  The sanitizer builds were running on the 12.1 image which since has
