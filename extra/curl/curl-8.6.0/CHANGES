Version 8.6.0 (31 Jan 2024)

Daniel Stenberg (31 Jan 2024)

- RELEASE-NOTES: synced

  curl 8.6.0

- THANKS: new contributors from 8.5.0

Jay Satiro (31 Jan 2024)

- cd2nroff: use perl 'strict' and 'warnings'

  - Use strict and warnings pragmas.

  - If open() fails then show the reason.

  - Set STDIN io layer :crlf so that input is properly read on Windows.

  - When STDIN is used as input, the filename $f is now set to "STDIN".

  Various error messages in single() use $f for the filename and this way
  it is not undefined when STDIN.

  Closes https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/12819

  Since the QUIC/h3 code has no knowledge or handling of multissl it might
  bring unintended consequences if we allow it.

Viktor Szakats (27 Jan 2024)

- build: delete/replace clang warning pragmas

  - delete redundant warning suppressions for `-Wformat-nonliteral`.
    This now relies on `CURL_PRINTF()` and it's theoratically possible
    that this macro isn't active but the warning is. We're ignoring this
    as a corner-case here.

  - replace two pragmas with code changes to avoid the warnings.

- sasl: make login option string override http auth

  - Use http authentication mechanisms as a default, not a preset.

  Consider http authentication options which are mapped to SASL options as
  a default (overriding the hardcoded default mask for the protocol) that
  is ignored if a login option string is given.

  Prior to this change, if some HTTP auth options were given, sasl mapped
  http authentication options to sasl ones but merged them with the login
  options.

  That caused problems with the cli tool that sets the http login option
  CURLAUTH_BEARER as a side-effect of --oauth2-bearer, because this flag
  maps to more than one sasl mechanisms and the latter cannot be cleared
  individually by the login options string.

  New test 992 checks this.

- cmake: rework options to enable curl and libcurl docs

  Rework CMake options for building/using curl tool and libcurl manuals.

  - rename `ENABLE_MANUAL` to `ENABLE_CURL_MANUAL`, meaning:
    to build man page and built-in manual for curl tool.

  - rename `BUILD_DOCS` to `BUILD_LIBCURL_DOCS`, meaning:
    to build man pages for libcurl.

  - `BUILD_LIBCURL_DOCS` now works without having to enable
    `ENABLE_CURL_MANUAL` too.

  - drop support for existing CMake-level `USE_MANUAL` option to avoid
    confusion. (It used to work with the effect of current
    `ENABLE_CURL_MANUAL`, but only by accident.)

  - cmake: speed up generating `.3` files by using a single command per

    commands by about a thousand. (There remains some CMake logic kicking
    in resulting in 500 -one per file- external `-E touch_nocreate` calls.)

  - cd2nroff: add ability to process multiple input files.

  - cd2nroff: add `-k` option to use the source filename to form the
    output filename. (instead of the default in-file `Title:` line.)

   - switch to building the curl.1 manpage using the "mainpage.idx" file,
     which lists the files to include to generate it, instead of using the
     previous page-footer/headers. Also, those files are now also .md
     ones, using the same format. I gave them underscore prefixes to make
     them sort separately:

  Closes #12753

Daniel Stenberg (23 Jan 2024)

- mksymbolsmanpage.pl: provide references to where the symbol is used

- docs: introduce "curldown" for libcurl man page format

  curldown is this new file format for libcurl man pages. It is markdown
  inspired with differences:

  - Each file has a set of leading headers with meta-data
  - Supports a small subset of markdown
  - Uses .md file extensions for editors/IDE/GitHub to treat them nicely
  - Generates man pages very similar to the previous ones
  - Generates man pages that still convert nicely to HTML on the website
  - Detects and highlights mentions of curl symbols automatically (when
    their man page section is specified)

  tools:

  - cd2nroff: converts from curldown to nroff man page
  - nroff2cd: convert an (old) nroff man page to curldown
  - cdall: convert many nroff pages to curldown versions
  - cd2cd: verifies and updates a curldown to latest curldown

  This setup generates .3 versions of all the curldown versions at build time.

  CI:

  Since the documentation is now technically markdown in the eyes of many
  things, the CI runs many more tests and checks on this documentation,
  including proselint, link checkers and tests that make sure we capitalize the
  first letter after a period...

- http3: initial support for OpenSSL 3.2 QUIC stack

  - HTTP/3 for curl using OpenSSL's own QUIC stack together

  - configure with `--with-openssl-quic` to enable curl to
    build this. This requires the nghttp3 library
  - implementation with the following restrictions:
    * macOS has to use an unconnected UDP socket due to an
      issue in OpenSSL's datagram implementation
      See https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/23251
      This makes connections to non-reponsive servers hang.
    * GET requests will send the indicator that they have
      no body in a separate QUIC packet. This may result
      in processing delays or Transfer-Encodings on proxied
      requests
    * uploads that encounter blocks will use 100% cpu as

- tool_getparam: stop supporting `@filename` style for --cookie

  The `@filename` style was never documented for --cookie <data|filename>
  but prior to this change curl would accept it anyway and always treat a
  @ prefixed string as a filename.

  That's a problem if the string also contains a = sign because then it is
  documented to be interpreted as a cookie string and not a filename.

  Example:

  `--cookie @foo=bar`

  Before: Interpreted as load cookies from filename foo=bar.

  After: Interpreted as cookie `@foo=bar` (name `@foo` and value `bar`).

  Other curl options with a data/filename option-value use the `@filename`
  to distinguish filenames which is probably how this happened. The
  --cookie option has never been documented that way.

- lib: replace readwrite with write_resp

  This clarifies the handling of server responses by folding the code for
  the complicated protocols into their protocol handlers. This concerns
  mainly HTTP and its bastard sibling RTSP.

  The terms "read" and "write" are often used without clear context if
  they refer to the connect or the client/application side of a
  transfer. This PR uses "read/write" for operations on the client side
  and "send/receive" for the connection, e.g. server side. If this is
  considered useful, we can revisit renaming of further methods in another
  PR.

  Curl's protocol handler `readwrite()` method been changed:

  ```diff
  -  CURLcode (*readwrite)(struct Curl_easy *data, struct connectdata *conn,
  -                        const char *buf, size_t blen,
  -                        size_t *pconsumed, bool *readmore);
  +  CURLcode (*write_resp)(struct Curl_easy *data, const char *buf, size_t ble
  n,
  +                         bool is_eos, bool *done);
  ```

  The name was changed to clarify that this writes reponse data to the
  client side. The parameter changes are:

  * `conn` removed as it always operates on `data->conn`
  * `pconsumed` removed as the method needs to handle all data on success
  * `readmore` removed as no longer necessary
  * `is_eos` as indicator that this is the last call for the transfer
    response (end-of-stream).
  * `done` TRUE on return iff the transfer response is to be treated as
    finished

  This change affects many files only because of updated comments in
  handlers that provide no implementation. The real change is that the
  HTTP protocol handlers now provide an implementation.

  The HTTP protocol handlers `write_resp()` implementation will get passed
  **all** raw data of a server response for the transfer. The HTTP/1.x
  formatted status and headers, as well as the undecoded response
  body. `Curl_http_write_resp_hds()` is used internally to parse the
  response headers and pass them on. This method is public as the RTSP
  protocol handler also uses it.

  HTTP/1.1 "chunked" transport encoding is now part of the general
  *content encoding* writer stack, just like other encodings. A new flag
  `CLIENTWRITE_EOS` was added for the last client write. This allows
  writers to verify that they are in a valid end state. The chunked
  decoder will check if it indeed has seen the last chunk.

  The general response handling in `transfer.c:466` happens in function
  `readwrite_data()`. This mainly operates now like:

  ```
  static CURLcode readwrite_data(data, ...)
  {
    do {
      Curl_xfer_recv_resp(data, buf)
      ...
      Curl_xfer_write_resp(data, buf)
      ...
    } while(interested);
    ...
  }
  ```

  All the response data handling is implemented in
  `Curl_xfer_write_resp()`. It calls the protocol handler's `write_resp()`
  implementation if available, or does the default behaviour.

  All raw response data needs to pass through this function. Which also
  means that anyone in possession of such data may call
  `Curl_xfer_write_resp()`.

- appveyor: replace PowerShell with bash + parallel autotools

  PowerShell works (after a steep development curve), but one property of
  it stuck and kept causing unresolvable usability issues: With
  `$ErrorActionPreference=Stop`, it does abort on failures, but shows only
  the first line of the error message. In `Continue` mode, it shows the
  full error message, but doesn't stop on all errors. Another issue is
  PowerShell considering any stderr output as if the command failed (this
  has been improved in 7.2 (2021-Nov), but fixed versions aren't running
  in CI and will not be for a long time in all test images.)

  Thus, we're going with bash.

  Also:
  - use `-j2` with autotools tests, making them finish 5-15 minutes per
    job faster.
  - omit `POSIX_PATH_PREFIX`.
  - use `WINDIR`.
  - prefer forward slashes.

  Align mingw with the other Windows compilers and use the `int` type for
  `CURL_TYPEOF_CURL_SOCKLEN_T` (and thus for `curl_socklent_t`). This
  makes it unnecessary to make a mingw-specific trick and pull all Windows
  headers early just for this type definition. This type is specific to
  Windows, not to the compiler. mingw-w64's Windows header maps it to
  `int` too.

  With this we also delete all remaining uses of `CURL_PULL_WS2TCPIP_H`.

  [ The official solution is to use `socklen_t` for all Windows compilers.
  In this case we may want to update `curl/curl.h` to pull in Windows

- readwrite_data: loop less

  This function is made to loop in order to drain incoming data
  faster. Completely removing the loop has a measerably negative impact on
  transfer speeds.

  Downsides with the looping include

  - it might call the progress callback much more seldom. Especially if
    the write callback is slow.

  - rate limiting becomes less exact

  - a single transfer might "starve out" other parallel transfers

  - QUIC timers for other connections can't be maintained correctly

  The long term fix should be to remove the loop and optimize coming back
  to avoid the transfer speed penalty.

  This fix lower the max loop count to reduce the starvation problem, and
  avoids the loop completely for when rate-limiting is in progress.

     and fc9bfb14520712672b4784e8b48256fb29204011 #11627, we explicitly
     enable PIC for libcurl shared lib. Or when building libcurl for
     shared and static lib in a single pass. We do this by default for
     Windows or when enabled by the user via `SHARE_LIB_OBJECT`.
     Otherwise we don't touch this setting. Meaning the default set by
     CMake (if any) or the toolchain is used. On Debian Bookworm, this
     means that PIC is disabled for static libs by default. Some platforms
     (like macOS), has PIC enabled by default.
     autotools supports the double-pass mode only, and in that case
     CMake seems to match PIC behaviour now (as tested on Linux with gcc.)

- cmake: delete obsolete TODO items [ci skip]

  There is always room for improvement, but CMake is up to par now with
  autotools, so there is no longer a good reason to keep around these
  inline TODO items.

  Answering one of questions:

  Q: "The gcc command line use neither -g nor any -O options. As a
     developer, I also treasure our configure scripts's --enable-debug
     option that sets a long range of "picky" compiler options."

  A: CMake offers the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable to control debug info
     and optimization level. E.g.:
     - `Release`    = `-O3` + no debug info
     - `MinSizeRel` = `-Os` + no debug info
     - `Debug`      = `-O0` + debug info

     https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#defaul

  Prior to this change autotools detection didn't work because it did not

  <openssl/x509v3.h>, but OpenSSL actually declares all the typedefs in
  <openssl/ossl_typ.h>, which is already included by <openssl/ssl.h> (and
  every other OpenSSL header), so just use that. Though I've included it

- tool_writeout_json: fix JSON encoding of non-ascii bytes

  This meant that the  *i<32  waas always true for bytes with the top bit
  set. So they were always getting encoded as \uXXXX, and then since they
  were also signed negative, they were getting extended with 1s causing
  '\xe2' to be expanded to \uffffffe2, for example:

    $ curl --variable 'v=“' --expand-write-out '{{v:json}}\n' file:///dev/nul
  l

- windows: use built-in `_WIN32` macro to detect Windows

  Windows compilers define `_WIN32` automatically. Windows SDK headers
  or build env defines `WIN32`, or we have to take care of it. The
  agreement seems to be that `_WIN32` is the preferred practice here.
  Make the source code rely on that to detect we're building for Windows.

  Public `curl.h` was using `WIN32`, `__WIN32__` and `CURL_WIN32` for
  Windows detection, next to the official `_WIN32`. After this patch it
  only uses `_WIN32` for this. Also, make it stop defining `CURL_WIN32`.

  There is a slight chance these break compatibility with Windows
  compilers that fail to define `_WIN32`. I'm not aware of any obsolete
  or modern compiler affected, but in case there is one, one possible
  solution is to define this macro manually.

  grepping for `WIN32` remains useful to discover Windows-specific code.

  Also:

  - extend `checksrc` to ensure we're not using `WIN32` anymore.

  - apply minor formatting here and there.

  - delete unnecessary checks for `!MSDOS` when `_WIN32` is present.

- build: add more picky warnings and fix them

  Enable more picky compiler warnings. I've found these options in the
  nghttp3 project when implementing the CMake quick picky warning
  functionality for it [1].

  `-Wunused-macros` was too noisy to keep around, but fixed a few issues
  it revealed while testing.

  - autotools: reflect the more precisely-versioned clang warnings.

  - autotools: avoid setting `-Wstrict-aliasing=3` twice.
  - autotools: disable `-Wmissing-noreturn` for MSYS gcc targets [2].
    It triggers in libtool-generated stub code.

  - lib/timeval: delete a redundant `!MSDOS` guard from a `WIN32` branch.

  - lib/curl_setup.h: delete duplicate declaration for `fileno`.
    Added in initial commit ae1912cb0d494b48d514d937826c9fe83ec96c4d
    (1999-12-29). This suggests this may not be needed anymore, but if
    it does, we may restore this for those specific (non-Windows) systems.
  - lib: delete unused macro `FTP_BUFFER_ALLOCSIZE` since
    c1d6fe2aaa5a26e49a69a4f2495b3cc7a24d9394.
  - lib: delete unused macro `isxdigit_ascii` since

    `Curl_freq` and `Curl_isVistaOrGreater` in CMake UNITY mode [4].
  - lib/warnless: fix double declarations in CMake UNITY mode [5].
    This was due to force-disabling the header guard of `warnless.h` to
    to reapply it to source code coming after `warnless.c` in UNITY
    builds. This reapplied declarations too, causing the warnings.
    Solved by adding a header guard for the lines that actually need
    to be reapplied.
  - lib/vauth/digest: fix `-Wunreachable-code-break` [6].
  - lib/vssh/libssh2: fix `-Wunreachable-code-break` and delete redundant

    Detected in `else` branches of dynamic feature checks, with results
    known at compile-time, e.g.
    ```c
    if(SecCertificateCopySubjectSummary)  /* -> true */
    ```
    Likely fixable as a separate micro-project, but given SecureTransport
    is deprecated anyway, let's just silence these locally.
  - src/tool_help: delete duplicate declaration for `helptext`.
  - src/tool_xattr: fix `-Wunreachable-code`.
  - tests: delete duplicate declaration for `unitfail` [8].
  - tests: delete duplicate declaration for `strncasecompare`.

    Originally added in 687df5c8c39c370a59999b9afc0917d808d978b7
    (2010-08-02).
    Got complicated later: c49e9683b85ba9d12cbb6eebc4ab2c8dba68fbdc
    If there are still systems around with warnings, we may restore the
    prototype, but limited for those systems.
  - tests/lib2305: delete duplicate declaration for
    `libtest_debug_config`.
  - tests/h2-download: fix `-Wunreachable-code-break`.

- autotools: stop setting `-std=gnu89` with `--enable-warnings`

  On one hand this alters warning results compared to a default build.
  On the other, it may produce different binaries, which is unexpected.

    and Visual Studio 2013 and newer. This fixes the printf mask warnings

  - conncache: fix printf format string [2].

  - http2: fix potential null pointer dereference [3].
    (seen on Slackware with gcc 11.)

  - libssh: fix printf format string in SFTP code [4].
    Also make MSVC builds compatible with old CRT versions.

  - libssh2: fix printf format string in SFTP code for MSVC.
    Applying the same fix as for libssh above.

  - unit1395: fix `argument is null` and related issues [5]:
    - stop calling `strcmp()` with NULL to avoid undefined behaviour.
    - fix checking results if some of them were NULL.
    - do not pass NULL to printf `%s`.

  - ci: keep a build job with `-std=gnu89` to continue testing for
    C89-compliance. We can apply this to other gcc jobs as needed.

- hyper: temporarily remove HTTP/2 support

  The current design of the Hyper integration requires rebuilding the
  Hyper clientconn for each request. However, building the clientconn
  requires resending the HTTP/2 connection preface, which is incorrect
  from a protocol perspective. That in turn causes servers to send GOAWAY
  frames, effectively degrading performance to "no connection reuse" in
  the best case. It may also be triggering some bugs where requests get
  dropped entirely and reconnects take too long.

  This doesn't rule out HTTP/2 support with Hyper, but it may take a
  redesign of the Hyper integration in order to make things work.

  Instead of a loop to scan over the potentially 30+ scheme names, this

  The perfect hash is generated by a separate tool (scripts/schemetable.c)

  This tool generates a scheme-matching table.

- urldata: move cookielist from UserDefined to UrlState

  1. Because the value is not strictly set with a setopt option.

  2. Because otherwise when duping a handle when all the set.* fields are
     first copied and an error happens (think out of memory mid-function),
     the function would easily free the list *before* it was deep-copied,
     which could lead to a double-free.

- autotools: avoid passing `LDFLAGS` twice to libcurl

  autotools passes `LDFLAGS` automatically linker commands. curl's
  `lib/Makefile.am` customizes libcurl linker flags. In that
  customization, it added `LDFLAGS` to the custom flags. This resulted in
  passing `LDFLAGS` _twice_ to the `libtool` command.

  Most of the time this is benign, but some `LDFLAGS` options can break
  the build when passed twice. One such example is passing `.o` files,
  e.g. `crt*.o` files necessary when customizing the C runtime, e.g. for
  MUSL builds.

  Passing them twice resulted in duplicate symbol errors:
  ```
  libtool: link:  clang-15 --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-musl [...] /usr/lib/a
  arch64-linux-musl/crt1.o [...] /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-musl/crt1.o [...]
  ld.lld-15: error: duplicate symbol: _start
  >>> defined at crt1.c
  >>>            /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-musl/crt1.o:(.text+0x0)
  >>> defined at crt1.c
  >>>            /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-musl/crt1.o:(.text+0x0)
  [...]
  clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocatio
  n)
  ```

  This behaviour came with commit 1a593191c2769a47b8c3e4d9715ec9f6dddf5e36
  (2013-07-23) as a fix for bug https://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1217.
  The patch was a works-for-me hack that ended up merged in curl:
  https://sourceforge.net/p/curl/bugs/1217/#06ef
  With the root cause remaining unclear.

  Perhaps the SUNPro 12 linker was sensitive to `-L` `-l` order, requiring
  `-L` first? This would be unusual and suggests a bug in either the
  linker or in `libtool`.

  The curl build does pass the list of detected libs via its own
  `LIBCURL_LIBS` variable, which ends up before `LDFLAGS` on the `libtool`
  command line, but it's the job of `libtool` to ensure that even
  a peculiar linker gets the options in the expected order. Also because
  autotools passes `LDFLAGS` last, making it hardly possible to pass
  anything after it.

  Perhaps in the 10 years since this issue, this already got a fix
  upstream.

  This patch deletes `LDFLAGS` from our customized libcurl options,
  leaving a single copy of them as passed by autotools automatically.

  Reverts 1a593191c2769a47b8c3e4d9715ec9f6dddf5e36
  Closes #12310

- autotools: accept linker flags via `CURL_LDFLAGS_{LIB,BIN}`

  To allow passing `LDFLAGS` specific to libcurl (`CURL_LDFLAGS_LIB`) and
  curl tool (`CURL_LDFLAGS_BIN`).

  This makes it possible to build libcurl and curl with a single
  invocation with lib- and tool-specific custom linker flags.

  Such flag can be enabling `.map` files, a `.def` file for libcurl DLL,
  controlling static/shared, incl. requesting a static curl tool (with
  `-static-libtool-libs`) while building both shared and static libcurl.

  curl-for-win uses the above and some more.

  These options are already supported in `Makefile.mk`. CMake has built-in
  variables for this.

- tool_cb_hdr: add an additional parsing check

  - Don't dereference the past-the-end element when parsing the server's
    Content-disposition header.

  As 'p' is advanced it can point to the past-the-end element and prior
  to this change 'p' could be dereferenced in that case.

  Technically the past-the-end element is not out of bounds because dynbuf
  (which manages the header line) automatically adds a null terminator to
  every buffer and that is not included in the buffer length passed to
  the header callback.

- misc: fix -Walloc-size warnings

  GCC 14 introduces a new -Walloc-size included in -Wextra which gives:

  ```
  src/tool_operate.c: In function ‘add_per_transfer’:
  src/tool_operate.c:213:5: warning: allocation of insufficient size ‘1’ fo
  r type ‘struct per_transfer’ with size ‘480’ [-Walloc-size]

  struct var’ with size ‘32’ [-Walloc-size]
    361 |   p = calloc(sizeof(struct var), 1);
        |     ^
  ```

  The calloc prototype is:
  ```
  void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);
      ```

  So, just swap the number of members and size arguments to match the
  prototype, as we're initialising 1 struct of size `sizeof(struct
  ...)`. GCC then sees we're not doing anything wrong.

  any of these features make curl require a C99 compiler. (In case of

  This patch changes the single use of `stdint.h` guarded by
  `HAVE_STDINT_H` to use `stdint.h` unconditionally. Also stop using
  `inttypes.h` as an alternative there. `HAVE_INTTYPES_H` wasn't used
  anywhere else, allowing to delete this feature check as well.

- rand: fix build error with autotools + LibreSSL

  autotools unexpectedly detects `arc4random` because it is also looking
  into dependency libs. One dependency, LibreSSL, happens to publish an
  `arc4random` function (via its shared lib before v3.7, also via static
  lib as of v3.8.2). When trying to use this function in `lib/rand.c`,
  its protoype is missing. To fix that, curl included a prototype, but
  that used a C99 type without including `stdint.h`, causing:

  ```
  ../../lib/rand.c:37:1: error: unknown type name 'uint32_t'
     37 | uint32_t arc4random(void);
        | ^
  1 error generated.
  ```

  This patch improves this by dropping the local prototype and instead
  limiting `arc4random` use for non-OpenSSL builds. OpenSSL builds provide
  their own random source anyway.

  The better fix would be to teach autotools to not link dependency libs
  while detecting `arc4random`.

  LibreSSL publishing a non-namespaced `arc4random` tracked here:

  curl can be built with IPv6 support (ENABLE_IPV6) but without the

  store with intermediate CAs). This is already allowed by the Schannel
  backend.

  Also this change makes partial chain verification possible for those
  certs since we allow partial chain verification by default for OpenSSL
  (unless CURLSSLOPT_NO_PARTIALCHAIN). This is not allowed by the Schannel
  backend.

- Makefile.mk: restore `_mingw.h` for default `_WIN32_WINNT`

  In 8.4.0 we deleted `_mingw.h` as part of purging old-mingw support.
  Turns out `_mingw.h` had the side-effect of setting a default
  `_WIN32_WINNT` value expected by `lib/config-win32.h` to enable
  `getaddrinfo` support in `Makefile.mk` mingw-w64 builds. This caused
  disabling support for this unless specifying the value manually.

  Restore this header and update its comment to tell why we continue
  to need it.

  This triggered a regression in official Windows curl builds starting
  with 8.4.0_1. Fixed in 8.4.0_6. (8.5.0 will be using CMake.)

- cmake: speed up zstd detection

  Before this patch we detected the presence of a specific zstd API to
  see if we can use the library. zstd published that API in its first
  stable release: v1.0.0 (2016-08-31).

  Replace that method by detecting the zstd library version instead and
  accepting if it's v1.0.0 or newer. Also display this detected version
  and display a warning if the zstd found is unfit for curl.

  We use the same version detection method as zstd itself, via its public
  C header.

  This deviates from autotools which keeps using the slow method of
  looking for the API by building a test program. The outcome is the same
  as long as zstd keeps offering this API.

- lib: introduce struct easy_poll_set for poll information

  Connection filter had a `get_select_socks()` method, inspired by the
  various `getsocks` functions involved during the lifetime of a
  transfer. These, depending on transfer state (CONNECT/DO/DONE/ etc.),
  return sockets to monitor and flag if this shall be done for POLLIN
  and/or POLLOUT.

  Due to this design, sockets and flags could only be added, not
  removed. This led to problems in filters like HTTP/2 where flow control
  prohibits the sending of data until the peer increases the flow
  window. The general transfer loop wants to write, adds POLLOUT, the
  socket is writeable but no data can be written.

  This leads to cpu busy loops. To prevent that, HTTP/2 did set the
  `SEND_HOLD` flag of such a blocked transfer, so the transfer loop cedes
  further attempts. This works if only one such filter is involved. If a
  HTTP/2 transfer goes through a HTTP/2 proxy, two filters are
  setting/clearing this flag and may step on each other's toes.

  Connection filters `get_select_socks()` is replaced by
  `adjust_pollset()`. They get passed a `struct easy_pollset` that keeps
  up to `MAX_SOCKSPEREASYHANDLE` sockets and their `POLLIN|POLLOUT`
  flags. This struct is initialized in `multi_getsock()` by calling the
  various `getsocks()` implementations based on transfer state, as before.

  After protocol handlers/transfer loop have set the sockets and flags
  they want, the `easy_pollset` is *always* passed to the filters. Filters
  "higher" in the chain are called first, starting at the first
  not-yet-connection one. Each filter may add sockets and/or change
  flags. When all flags are removed, the socket itself is removed from the
  pollset.

  Example:

   * transfer wants to send, adds POLLOUT
   * http/2 filter has a flow control block, removes POLLOUT and adds
     POLLIN (it is waiting on a WINDOW_UPDATE from the server)
   * TLS filter is connected and changes nothing
   * h2-proxy filter also has a flow control block on its tunnel stream,
     removes POLLOUT and adds POLLIN also.
   * socket filter is connected and changes nothing
   * The resulting pollset is then mixed together with all other transfers
     and their pollsets, just as before.

  Use of `SEND_HOLD` is no longer necessary in the filters.

  All filters are adapted for the changed method. The handling in
  `multi.c` has been adjusted, but its state handling the the protocol
  handlers' `getsocks` method are untouched.

  The most affected filters are http/2, ngtcp2, quiche and h2-proxy. TLS
  filters needed to be adjusted for the connecting handshake read/write
  handling.

  No noticeable difference in performance was detected in local scorecard
  runs.

- cmake: pre-fill rest of detection values for Windows

  The goal of this patch is to avoid unnecessary feature detection work
  when doing Windows builds with CMake. Do this by pre-filling well-known
  detection results for Windows and specifically for mingw-w64 and MSVC
  compilers. Also limit feature checks to platforms where the results are
  actually used. Drop a few redundant ones. And some tidying up.

  - pre-fill remaining detection values in Windows CMake builds.

    Based on actual detection results observed in CI runs, preceding
    similar work over libssh2 and matching up values with
    `lib/config-win32.h`.

    This brings down CMake configuration time from 58 to 14 seconds on the
    same local machine.

    On AppVeyor CI this translates to:
    - 128 seconds -> 50 seconds VS2022 MSVC with OpenSSL (per CMake job):
      https://ci.appveyor.com/project/curlorg/curl/builds/48208419/job/4gw66ecr
  jpy7necb#L296
      https://ci.appveyor.com/project/curlorg/curl/builds/48217440/job/8m4fwrr2
  fe249uo8#L186
    - 62 seconds -> 16 seconds VS2017 MINGW (per CMake job):
      https://ci.appveyor.com/project/curlorg/curl/builds/48208419/job/s1y8q5iv
  lcs7ub29?fullLog=true#L290
      https://ci.appveyor.com/project/curlorg/curl/builds/48217440/job/pchpxyjs
  yc9kl13a?fullLog=true#L194

    The formula is about 1-3 seconds delay for each detection. Almost all
    of these trigger a full compile-link cycle behind the scenes, slow
    even today, both cross and native, mingw-w64 and apparently MSVC too.
    Enabling .map files or other custom build features slows it down
    further. (Similar is expected for autotools configure.)

  - stop detecting `idn2.h` if idn2 was deselected.
    autotools does this.

  - stop detecting `idn2.h` if idn2 was not found.
    This deviates from autotools. Source code requires both header and
    lib, so this is still correct, but faster.

  - limit `ADDRESS_FAMILY` detection to Windows.

  - normalize `HAVE_WIN32_WINNT` value to lowercase `0x0a12` format.

  - pre-fill `HAVE_WIN32_WINNT`-dependent detection results.
    Saving 4 (slow) feature-detections in most builds: `getaddrinfo`,
    `freeaddrinfo`, `inet_ntop`, `inet_pton`

  - fix pre-filled `HAVE_SYS_TIME_H`, `HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H`,
    `HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY` for mingw-w64.
    Luckily this do not change build results, as `WIN32` took
    priority over `HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY` with the current source
    code.

  - limit `HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME_MONOTONIC_RAW` and
    `HAVE_CLOCK_GETTIME_MONOTONIC` detections to non-Windows.
    We're not using these in the source code for Windows.

  - reduce compiler warning noise in CMake internal logs:
    - fix to include `winsock2.h` before `windows.h`.
      Apply it to autotools test snippets too.
    - delete previous `-D_WINSOCKAPI_=` hack that aimed to fix the above.
    - cleanup `CMake/CurlTests.c` to emit less warnings.

  - delete redundant `HAVE_MACRO_SIGSETJMP` feature check.
    It was the same check as `HAVE_SIGSETJMP`.

  - delete 'experimental' marking from `CURL_USE_OPENSSL`.

  - show CMake version via `CMakeLists.txt`.

- tests: Fix Windows test helper tool search & use it for handle64

  The checkcmd() and checktestcmd() functions would not have worked on
  Windows due to hard-coding the UNIX PATH separator character and not
  adding .exe file extension. This meant that tools like stunnel, valgrind
  and nghttpx would not have been found and used on Windows, and
  inspection of previous test runs show none of those being found in pure
  Windows CI builds.

  With this fixed, they can be used to detect the handle64.exe program
  before attempting to use it. When handle64.exe was called
  unconditionally without it existing, it caused perl to abort the test
  run with the error

      The running command stopped because the preference variable

- cmake: replace `check_library_exists_concat()`

  The idea of `check_library_exists_concat()` is that it detects an
  optional component and adds it to the list of libs that we also use in
  subsequent component checks. This caused problems when detecting
  components with unnecessary dependencies that were not yet built.

  CMake offers the `CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES` variable to set libs used
  for component checks, which we already use in most cases. That left 4
  uses of `check_library_exists_concat()`. Only one of these actually
  needed the 'concat' feature (ldap/lber).

  Delete this function and replace it with standard
  `check_library_exists()` and manual management of our `CURL_LIBS`
  list we use when linking build targets. And special logic to handle the
  ldap/lber case.

  (We have a similar function for headers: `check_include_file_concat()`.
  It works, but problematic for performance reasons and because it hides
  the actual headers required in `check_symbol_exists()` calls.)

  Prior to this change the SOCKS5 test server did not check that all parts
  of the handshake were received successfully. If those parts were missing
  or too short then the server would access uninitialized memory.

  This issue was discovered in CI job 'memory-sanitizer' test results.
  Test 2055 was failing due to the SOCKS5 test server not running. It was
  not running because either it crashed or memory sanitizer aborted it
  during Test 728. Test 728 connects to the SOCKS5 test server on a

- http2: safer invocation of populate_binsettings

  populate_binsettings now returns a negative value on error, instead of a

  updated to handle this change in its contract.

  The way populate_binsettings had been used prior to this change the huge
  positive values -- due to signed->unsigned conversion of the potentially
  negative result of nghttp2_pack_settings_payload which returns negative
  values on error -- are not possible. But only because http2.c currently
  always provides a large enough output buffer and provides H2 SETTINGS
  IVs which pass the verification logic inside nghttp2.  If the
  verification logic were to change or if http2.c started passing in more
  IVs without increasing the output buffer size, the overflow could become
  reachable, and libcurl/curl might start leaking memory contents to
  servers/proxies...

    autotools does this. autotools also publishes this detection result

    doesn't use this value. (it might need to be remove-listed in

- cmake: fix unity with Windows Unicode + TrackMemory

  Found the root cause of the startup crash in unity builds with Unicode
  and TrackMemory enabled at the same time.

  We must make sure that the `memdebug.h` header doesn't apply to
  `lib/curl_multibyte.c` (as even noted in a comment there.) In unity
  builds all headers apply to all sources, including `curl_multibyte.c`.
  This probably resulted in an infinite loop on startup.

  Exclude this source from unity compilation with TrackMemory enabled,
  in both libcurl and curl tool. Enable unity mode for a debug Unicode
  CI job to keep it tested. Also delete the earlier workaround that
  fully disabled unity for affected builds.

- cmake: disable unity mode with Windows Unicode + TrackMemory

  "TrackMemory" is `ENABLE_DEBUG=ON` (aka `ENABLE_CURLDEBUG=ON`,
  aka `-DCURLDEBUG`).

  There is an issue with memory tracking and Unicode when built in "unity"
  mode, which results in the curl tool crashing right on startup, even
  without any command-line option. Interestingly this doesn't happen under
  WINE (at least on the system I tested this on), but consistenly happens
  on real Windows machines. Crash is 0xC0000374 heap corruption. Both
  shared and static curl executables are affected.

  This limitation probably won't hit too many people, but it remains
  a TODO to find and fix the root cause and drop this workaround.

- appveyor: rewrite batch in PowerShell + CI improvements

  1. Rewrite in PowerShell:

  - rewrite MS-DOS batch build script in PowerShell.
  - move some bash operations into native PowerShell.
  - fixups for PowerShell insisting on failure when a command outputs
    something to stderr.
  - fix to actually run `curl -V` after every build.
    (and exclude ARM64 builds.)
  - also say why we skipped `curl -V` if we had to skip.
  - fix CMake warnings about unused configuration variables, by adapting
    these dynamically for build cases.
  - dedupe OpenSSL path into a variable.
  - disable `test1451` failing with a warning anyway due to missing python
    impacket. (after trying and failing to install impacket)
    PowerShell promotes these warnings to errors by PowerShell. We can also
    suppress they wholesale if they start causing issues in the future,
    like we already to with `autoreconf` and `./configure`.

  PowerShell is better than MS-DOS batches, so the hope is this makes it
  easier to extend and maintain the AppVeyor build logic. POSIX/bash isn't
  supported inline by AppVeyor on Windows build machines, but we are okay
  to keep it in an external script, so it's also an option.

  2. CI improvements:

  - enable tests for a "unity" build job.
  - speed-up CI initialization by using shallow clones of the curl repo.
  - speed-up CMake MSVC jobs with `TrackFileAccess=false`.
  - enable parallelism in `VisualStudioSolution` builds.
  - display CMake version before builds.
  - always show the CPU in job names.
  - tell which jobs are build-only in job names.
  - move `TESTING:` value next to `DISABLED_TESTS:` in two jobs.
  - add `config.log` (autotools) to dumped logs (need to enable manually).

  3. Style:

  - use single-quotes in YAML like we do in other CI YAML files.
    It also allows to drop quoting characters and lighter to write/read.
    (keep double quotes for PowerShell strings needing expansion.)

  Closes #11999

- cmake: fix `HAVE_LDAP_SSL`, `HAVE_LDAP_URL_PARSE` on non-Windows

  - set `HAVE_LDAP_URL_PARSE` if `ldap_url_parse` function exists.
    Before this patch we set it based it on the presence of `stricmp`,
    which correctly enabled it on e.g. Windows, but was inaccurate for
    other platforms.

  - always set `HAVE_LDAP_SSL` if an LDAP backend is detected and
    LDAPS is not explicitly disabled. This mimics autotools behaviour.
    Previously we set it only for Windows LDAP. After this fix, LDAPS is
    correctly enabled in default macOS builds.

  - enable LDAP[S] for a CMake macOS CI job. Target OS X 10.9 (Mavericks)
    to avoid deprecation warnings for LDAP API.

  - always detect `HAVE_LDAP_SSL_H`, even with LDAPS explicitly disabled.
    This doesn't make much sense, but let's do it to sync behaviour with
    autotools.

  - fix benign typo in variable name.

  I did miss the fact that this had two dependent checks:

  autotools always runs all 3 probes for non-fast-tracked systems and
  enables this feature if any one of them was successful. To save
  configuration time,  CMake stops at the first successful check.

- tool: use our own stderr variable

  Earlier this year we changed our own stderr variable to use the standard
  name `stderr` (to avoid bugs where someone is using `stderr` instead of
  the curl-tool specific variable). This solution needed to override the
  standard `stderr` symbol via the preprocessor. This in turn didn't play
  well with unity builds and caused curl tool to crash or stay silent due
  to an uninitialized stderr. This was a hard to find issue, fixed by
  manually breaking out one file from the unity sources.

  To avoid two these two tricks, this patch implements a different
  solution: Restore using our own local variable for our stderr output and
  leave `stderr` as-is. To avoid using `stderr` by mistake, add a
  `checksrc` rule (based on logic we already used in lib for `strerror`)
  that detects any `stderr` use in `src` and points to using our own

- multi: round the timeout up to prevent early wakeups

  Curl_timediff rounds down to the millisecond, so curl_multi_perform can
  be called too early, then we get a timeout of 0 and call it again.

  The code already handled the case of timeouts which expired less than
  1ms in the future.  By rounding up, we make sure we will never ask the
  platform to wake up too early.

- inet_ntop: add typecast to silence Coverity

  CID 1024653:  Integer handling issues  (SIGN_EXTENSION)

  Suspicious implicit sign extension: "src[i]" with type "unsigned char
  const" (8 bits, unsigned) is promoted in "src[i] << (1 - i % 2 << 3)" to
  type "int" (32 bits, signed), then sign-extended to type "unsigned long"
  (64 bits, unsigned).  If "src[i] << (1 - i % 2 << 3)" is greater than
  0x7FFFFFFF, the upper bits of the result will all be 1.

  111         words[i/2] |= (src[i] << ((1 - (i % 2)) << 3));

  The value will not be greater than 0x7FFFFFFF so this still cannot
  happen.

  Also, switch to ints here instead of longs. The values stored are 16 bit
  so at least no need to use 64 bit variables. Also, longs are 32 bit on
  some platforms so this logic still needs to work with 32 bits.

- cmake: move global headers to specific checks

  Before this patch we added standard headers unconditionally to the

  Stop using `stddef.h`, as it seems unnecessary.

  dependencies.

  Also delete checking for the C89 standard header `time.h`, that I
  missed in the earlier commit.

- mingw: delete support for legacy mingw.org toolchain

  Drop support for "old" / "legacy" / "classic" / "v1" / "mingw32" MinGW:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW, https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/
  Its homepage used to be http://mingw.org/ [no HTTPS], and broken now.
  It supported the x86 CPU only and used a old Windows API header and
  implib set, often causing issues. It also misses most modern Windows
  features, offering old versions of both binutils and gcc (no llvm/clang
  support). It was last updated 2 years ago.

  curl now relies on toolchains based on the mingw-w64 project:

- libssh2: fix error message on failed pubkey-from-file

  - If libssh2_userauth_publickey_fromfile_ex returns -1 then show error
    message "SSH public key authentication failed: Reason unknown (-1)".

  When libssh2_userauth_publickey_fromfile_ex returns -1 it does so as a
  generic error and therefore doesn't set an error message. AFAICT that is
  not documented behavior.

  Prior to this change libcurl retrieved the last set error message which
  would be from a previous function failing. That resulted in misleading
  auth failed error messages in verbose mode.

- tftpd: always use curl's own tftp.h

  Using the system's provided arpa/tftp.h and optimizing, GCC 12 detects
  and reports a stringop-overread warning:

  tftpd.c: In function ‘write_behind.isra’:
  tftpd.c:485:12: warning: ‘write’ reading between 1 and 2147483647 bytes f
  rom a region of size 0 [-Wstringop-overread]
    485 |     return write(test->ofile, writebuf, count);
        |            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In file included from tftpd.c:71:
  /usr/include/arpa/tftp.h:58:30: note: source object ‘tu_data’ of size 0
     58 |                         char tu_data[0];        /* data or error stri
  ng */
        |                              ^~~~~~~

  This occurs because writebuf points to this field and the latter
  cannot be considered as being of dynamic length because it is not
  the last field in the structure. Thus it is bound to its declared
  size.

  This commit always uses curl's own version of tftp.h where the
  target field is last in its structure, effectively avoiding the
  warning.

  As HAVE_ARPA_TFTP_H is not used anymore, cmake/configure checks for
  arpa/tftp.h are removed.

- CI: ignore the "flaky" and "timing-dependent" test results

  CI builds will now run these tests, but will ignore the results if they

  which are often heavily overloaded and slow.

    a variable multiple times.

  This is a follow-up to 291d225a which changed Curl_isunreserved into an
  alias macro for ISUNRESERVED. The problem is the former is not easily
  identified as a macro by the caller, which could lead to a bug.

  Curl_isunreserved(*foo++) is not even though they both are the same.

- tests: increase the default server logs lock timeout

  This timeout is used to wait for the server to finish writing its logs
  before checking them against the expected values. An overloaded machine
  could take more than the two seconds previously allocated, so increase
  the timeout to 5 seconds.

  Ref: #11328
  Closes #11834

- tests: increase TEST_HANG_TIMEOUT in two tests

  These tests had a 5 second timeout compared to 60 seconds for all other
  tests. Make these consistent with the others for more reliability on
  heavily-loaded machines.

  Ref: #11328

- test1056: disable on Windows

  This test relies on the IPv6 scope field being ignored when connecting to
  ipv6-localhost (i.e. [::1%259999] is treated as [::1]). Maybe this is a bit
  dodgy, but it works on all our test platforms except Windows. This
  test was disabled manually on all Windows CI builds already, so instead
  add an incompatible feature and precheck so it's skipped on Windows
  everywhere automatically.

- test587: add a slight delay after test

  This test is designed to connect to the server, then immediately send a
  few bytes and disconnect. In some situations, such as on a loaded
  server, this doesn't give the server enough time to write its lock file
  before its existence is checked. The test harness then fails to find the
  server's input log file (because it hasn't been written yet) and fails
  the test. By adding a short delay after the test, the HTTP server has
  enough time to write its lock file which gives itself more time to write
  its remaining files.

  Ref: #11328

- tests: stop overriding the lock timeout

  These tests reduce the server lock wait timeout which can increase
  flakiness on loaded machines. Since this is merely an optimization,
  eliminate them in favour of reliability.

  Ref: #11328

- tests: add some --expect100-timeout to reduce timing dependencies

  These tests can fail when the test machine is so slow that the test HTTP
  server didn't get a chance to complete before the client's one second
  100-continue timeout triggered. Increase that 1 second to 999 seconds so
  this situation doesn't happen.

  Ref: #11328

- test661: return from test early in case of curl error

- tests: add the timing-dependent keyword on several tests

  These are ones likely to fail on heavily-loaded machines that alter the
  normal test timing. Most of these tests already had the flaky keyword
  since this condition makes them more likely to fail on CI.

- test1592: greatly increase the maximum test timeout

  It was too short to be reliable on heavily loaded CI machines, and
  as a fail-safe only, it didn't need to be short.

  Ref: #11328

- test: minor test cleanups

  Remove an obsolete block of code in tests 2032 & 576.
  Add a comment in test 1474.

- tests: quadruple the %FTPTIME2 and %FTPTIME3 timeouts

  This gives more of a margin for error when running on overloaded CI
  servers.

  Ref: #11328

- tests: improve SLOWDOWN test reliability by reducing sent data

  These tests are run in SLOWDOWN mode which adds a 10 msec delay after
  each character output, which means it takes at least 1.6 seconds (and
  320 kernel calls) just to get through the long welcome banner. On an
  overloaded system, this can end up taking much more than 1.6 seconds,
  and even more than the 7 or 16 second curl timeout that the tests rely
  on, causing them to fail. Reducing the size of the welcome banner drops
  the total number of characters sent before the transfer starts by more
  than half, which reduces the opportunity for test-breaking slowdowns by
  the same amount.

  used by SSPI builds already uses the hostname to generate the spn.

- hyper: remove `hyptransfer->endtask`

  `Curl_hyper_stream` needs to distinguish between two kinds of
  `HYPER_TASK_EMPTY` tasks: (a) the `foreach` tasks it creates itself, and
  (b) background tasks that hyper produces. It does this by recording the
  address of any `foreach` task in `hyptransfer->endtask` before pushing
  it into the executor, and then comparing that against the address of
  tasks later polled out of the executor.

  This works right now, but there is no guarantee from hyper that the
  addresses are stable. `hyper_executor_push` says "The executor takes
  ownership of the task, which should not be accessed again unless
  returned back to the user with `hyper_executor_poll`". That wording is a
  bit ambiguous but with my Rust programmer's hat on I read it as meaning
  the task returned with `hyper_executor_poll` may be conceptually the
  same as a task that was pushed, but that there are no other guarantees
  and comparing addresses is a bad idea.

  This commit instead uses `hyper_task_set_userdata` to mark the `foreach`
  task with a `USERDATA_RESP_BODY` value which can then be checked for,
  removing the need for `hyptransfer->endtask`. This makes the code look
  more like that hyper C API examples, which use userdata for every task
  and never look at task addresses.

  Also, previously, the assumption was made that --libs-only-l and
  --libs-only-L are the full decomposition of --libs, which is untrue and
  would not allow linking against a static zlib. The new approach is
  better in that it uses --libs, although only if --libs-only-l returns

- CI: switch macOS ARM build from Cirrus to Circle CI

  Cirrus is drastically reducing their free tier on Sept. 1, so they will
  no longer perform all these builds for us. All but one build has been
  moved, with the LibreSSL one being dropped because of linking problems
  on Circle.

  One important note about this change is that Circle CI is currently
  directing all these builds to x86_64 hardware, despite them requesting
  ARM. This is because ARM nodes are scheduled to be available on the
  free tier only in December. This reduces our architectural diversity
  until then but it should automatically come back once those machines are
  enabled.

- CI: use the right variable for BSD make

  BSD uses MAKEFLAGS instead of MAKE_FLAGS so it wasn't doing parallel
  builds before.

- CI: drop the FreeBSD 12.X build

  Cirrus' new free tier won't let us have many builds, so drop the
  nonessential ones. The FreeBSD 13.X build will still give us the most
  relevant FreeBSD coverage.

- CI: move the Alpine build from Cirrus to GHA

  Cirrus is reducing their free tier to next to nothing, so we must move

- connect: stop halving the remaining timeout when less than 600 ms left

  When curl wants to connect to a host, it always has a TIMEOUT. The
  maximum time it is allowed to spend until a connect is confirmed.

  curl will try to connect to each of the IP adresses returned for the
  host. Two loops, one for each IP family.

  During the connect loop, while curl has more than one IP address left to
  try within a single address family, curl has traditionally allowed (time
  left/2) for *this* connect attempt. This, to not get stuck on the
  initial addresses in case the timeout but still allow later addresses to
  get attempted.

  This has the downside that when users set a very short timeout and the
  host has a large number of IP addresses, the effective result might be
  that every attempt gets a little too short time.

  This change stop doing the divided-by-two if the total time left is
  below a threshold. This threshold is 600 milliseconds.

  if(-x $stunnel or -x "$stunnel")
  # false even if path exists and is executable

  Our other test scripts written in perl, unlike this one, use servers.pm

- hyper: fix ownership problems

  Some of these changes come from comparing `Curl_http` and
  `start_CONNECT`, which are similar, and adding things to them that are
  present in one and missing in another.

  The most important changes:
  - In `start_CONNECT`, add a missing `hyper_clientconn_free` call on the
    happy path.
  - In `start_CONNECT`, add a missing `hyper_request_free` on the error
    path.
  - In `bodysend`, add a missing `hyper_body_free` on an early-exit path.
  - In `bodysend`, remove an unnecessary `hyper_body_free` on a different
    error path that would cause a double-free.
    https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/ffi/fn.hyper_request_set_body.html
    says of `hyper_request_set_body`: "This takes ownership of the
    hyper_body *, you must not use it or free it after setting it on the
    request." This is true even if `hyper_request_set_body` returns an
    error; I confirmed this by looking at the hyper source code.

  This didn't affect curl because we call ERR_clear_error before every
  write operation (a0dd9df9ab35528eb9eb669e741a5df4b1fb833c), but when
  libcurl is used in a process with other OpenSSL users, they may detect
  an OpenSSL error pushed by libcurl's SSL_shutdown as if it was their
  own.

- c-hyper: fix a memory leak in `Curl_http`.

  A request created with `hyper_request_new` must be consumed by either
  `hyper_clientconn_send` or `hyper_request_free`.

  This is not terrifically clear from the hyper docs --
  `hyper_request_free` is documented only with "Free an HTTP request if
  not going to send it on a client" -- but a perusal of the hyper code
  confirms it.

  This commit adds a `hyper_request_free` to the `error:` path in
  `Curl_http` so that the request is consumed when an error occurs after
  the request is created but before it is sent.

  Fixes the first memory leak reported by Valgrind in #10803.

  - with CMake, use the variable `WINDOWS_STORE` to detect an UWP build

    allows to drop two dynamic feature checks.

    `WINDOWS_STORE` is true when invoking CMake with

    Ref: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/WINDOWS_STORE.html

  - with autotools, drop the separate feature check for `wincrypt.h`. On
    one hand this header has been present for long (even Borland C 5.5 had
    it from year 2000), on the other we used the check result solely to
    enable another check for certain crypto functions. This fails anyway
    with the header not present. We save one dynamic feature check at the

  Add `test1279` to verify that `libcurl.def` lists all exported API
  functions found in libcurl headers.

  Also:

  - extend test suite XML `stdout` tag with the `loadfile` attribute.

  - fix `tests/extern-scan.pl` and `test1135` to include websocket API.

  - use all headers (sorted) in `test1135` instead of a manual list.

  - add options `--sort`, `--heading=` to `tests/extern-scan.pl`.

  - add `libcurl.def` to the auto-labeler GHA task.

- url: change default value for CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS to 30

  It was previously unlimited by default, but that's not a sensible
  default. While changing this has a remote risk of breaking an existing
  use case, I figure it is more likely to actually save users from loops.

- schannel: fix user-set legacy algorithms in Windows 10 & 11

  - If the user set a legacy algorithm list (CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST) then
    use the SCHANNEL_CRED legacy structure to pass the list to Schannel.

  - If the user set both a legacy algorithm list and a TLS 1.3 cipher list
    then abort.

  Although MS doesn't document it, Schannel will not negotiate TLS 1.3
  when SCHANNEL_CRED is used. That means setting a legacy algorithm list
  limits the user to earlier versions of TLS.

  Prior to this change, since 8beff435 (precedes 7.85.0), libcurl would
  ignore legacy algorithms in Windows 10 1809 and later.

- egd: delete feature detection and related source code

  EGD is Entropy Gathering Daemon, a socket-based entropy source supported
  by pre-OpenSSL v1.1 versions and now deprecated. curl also deprecated it
  a while ago.

  Its detection in CMake was broken all along because OpenSSL libs were
  not linked at the point of feature check.

  Delete detection from both cmake and autotools, along with the related
  source snippet, and the `--with-egd-socket=` `./configure` option.

Viktor Szakats (1 Aug 2023)

- cmake: add support for single libcurl compilation pass

  Before this patch CMake builds used two separate compilation passes to
  build the shared and static libcurl respectively. This patch allows to
  reduce that to a single pass if the target platform and build settings
  allow it.

  This reduces CMake build times when building both static and shared
  libcurl at the same time, making these dual builds an almost zero-cost
  option.

  Enable this feature for Windows builds, where the difference between the
  two passes was the use of `__declspec(dllexport)` attribute for exported
  API functions for the shared builds. This patch replaces this method
  with the use of `libcurl.def` at DLL link time.

  Also update `Makefile.mk` to use `libcurl.def` to export libcurl API
  symbols on Windows. This simplifies (or fixes) this build method (e.g.
  in curl-for-win, which generated a `libcurl.def` from `.h` files using
  an elaborate set of transformations).

  `libcurl.def` has the maintenance cost of keeping the list of public
  libcurl API symbols up-to-date. This list seldom changes, so the cost
  is low.

  Closes #11546

- cmake: detect `SSL_set0_wbio` in OpenSSL

  Present in OpenSSL 1.1.0 and BoringSSL.
  Missing from LibreSSL 3.8.0.

  Follow-up to f39472ea9f4f4e12cfbc0500c4580a8d52ce4a59

  While here, also fix `RAND_egd()` detection which was broken, likely all
  along. This feature is probably broken with CMake builds and also
  requires a sufficiently obsolete OpenSSL version, so this part of the
  update was not tested.

  Closes #11555
