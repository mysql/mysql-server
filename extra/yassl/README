*** Note, Please read ***

yaSSL takes a different approach to certificate verification than OpenSSL does.
The default policy for the client is to verify the server, this means that if
you don't load CAs to verify the server you'll get a connect error, unable to 
verify.  It you want to mimic OpenSSL behavior of not verifying the server and
reducing security you can do this by calling:

SSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx, SSL_VERIFY_NONE, 0);

before calling SSL_new();

yaSSL Release notes, version 2.4.4 (8/8/2017)
    This release of yaSSL fixes an interop issue. A fix for detecting cipher
    suites with non leading zeros is included as yaSSL only supports cipher
    suites with leading zeros.  Thanks for the report from Security Innovation
    and Oracle.

    Users interoping with other SSL stacks should update.

yaSSL Release notes, version 2.4.2 (9/22/2016)
    This release of yaSSL fixes a medium security vulnerability. A fix for
    potential AES side channel leaks is included that a local user monitoring
    the same CPU core cache could exploit.  VM users, hyper-threading users,
    and users where potential attackers have access to the CPU cache will need
    to update if they utilize AES.

    DSA padding fixes for unusual sizes is included as well.  Users with DSA
    certficiates should update.

yaSSL Release notes, version 2.4.0 (5/20/2016)
    This release of yaSSL fixes the OpenSSL compatibility function
    SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations() when using the path directory to allow
    unlimited path sizes.  Minor Windows build fixes are included.
    No high level security fixes in this version but we always recommend
    updating.


yaSSL Release notes, version 2.3.9b (2/03/2016)
    This release of yaSSL fixes the OpenSSL compatibility function
    X509_NAME_get_index_by_NID() to use the actual index of the common name
    instead of searching on the format prefix.  Thanks for the report from
    yashwant.sahu@oracle.com  .  Anyone using this function should update.

yaSSL Release notes, version 2.3.9 (12/01/2015)
    This release of yaSSL fixes two client side Diffie-Hellman problems.
    yaSSL was only handling the cases of zero or one leading zeros for the key
    agreement instead of potentially any number.  This caused about 1 in 50,000
    connections to fail when using DHE cipher suites.  The second problem was
    the case where a server would send a public value shorter than the prime
    value, causing about 1 in 128 client connections to fail, and also
    caused the yaSSL client to read off the end of memory.  All client side
    DHE cipher suite users should update.
    Thanks to Adam Langely (agl@imperialviolet.org) for the detailed report!

yaSSL Release notes, version 2.3.8 (9/17/2015)
    This release of yaSSL fixes a high security vulnerability.  All users
    SHOULD update.  If using yaSSL for TLS on the server side with private
    RSA keys allowing ephemeral key exchange you MUST update and regenerate
    the RSA private keys.  This report is detailed in:
    https://people.redhat.com/~fweimer/rsa-crt-leaks.pdf
    yaSSL now detects RSA signature faults and returns an error.

yaSSL Patch notes, version 2.3.7e (6/26/2015)
    This release of yaSSL includes a fix for Date less than comparison.
    Previously yaSSL would return true on less than comparisons if the Dates
    were equal. Reported by Oracle. No security problem, but if a cert was
    generated right now, a server started using it in the same second, and a
    client tried to verify it in the same second it would report not yet valid.

yaSSL Patch notes, version 2.3.7d (6/22/2015)
    This release of yaSSL includes a fix for input_buffer set_current with
    index 0.  SSL_peek() at front of waiting data could trigger.  Robert
    Golebiowski of Oracle identified and suggested a fix, thanks!

yaSSL Patch notes, version 2.3.7c (6/12/2015)
    This release of yaSSL does certificate DATE comparisons to the second
    instead of to the minute, helpful when using freshly generated certs.
    Though keep in mind that time sync differences could still show up.

yaSSL Patch notes, version 2.3.7b (3/18/2015)
    This release of yaSSL fixes a potential crash with corrupted private keys.
    Also detects bad keys earlier for user.

yaSSL Release notes, version 2.3.7 (12/10/2014)
    This release of yaSSL fixes the potential to process duplicate handshake
    messages by explicitly marking/checking received handshake messages.

yaSSL Release notes, version 2.3.6 (11/25/2014)

    This release of yaSSL fixes some valgrind warnings/errors including
    uninitialized reads and off by one index errors induced from fuzzing
    the handshake.  These were reported by Oracle.

    Since yaSSL now supports zlib, as does libcurl, the libcurl build test can
    fail if yaSSL is built with zlib support since the zlib library isn't 
    passed.  You can do two things to fix this: 

        1) build yaSSL w/o zlib --without-zlib
        2) or add flags to curl configure LDFLAGS="-lm -lz"



*****************yaSSL Release notes, version 1.5.0 (11/09/06)

    This release of yaSSL contains bug fixes, portability enhancements,
    and full TLS 1.1 support.  Use the functions:

        SSL_METHOD *TLSv1_1_server_method(void);
        SSL_METHOD *TLSv1_1_client_method(void);
    
    or the SSLv23 versions (even though yaSSL doesn't support SSL 2.0 the v23
    means to pick the highest of SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, or TLS 1.1).


See normal  build instructions below under 1.0.6.
See libcurl build instructions below under 1.3.0.



****************yaSSL Release notes, version 1.4.5 (10/15/06)


    This release of yaSSL contains bug fixes, portability enhancements,
    zlib compression support, removal of assembly instructions at runtime if
    not supported, and initial TLS 1.1 support.


    Compression Notes:  yaSSL uses zlib for compression and the compression
    should only be used if yaSSL is at both ends because the implementation
    details aren't yet standard.  If you'd like to turn compression on use
    the SSL_set_compression() function on the client before calling
    SSL_connect().  If both the client and server were built with zlib support
    then the connection will use compression.  If the client isn't built with
    support then SSL_set_compression() will return an error (-1).

    To build yaSSL with zlib support on Unix simply have zlib support on your
    system and configure will find it if it's in the standard locations.  If
    it's somewhere else use the option ./configure --with-zlib=DIR.  If you'd
    like to disable compression support in yaSSL use ./configure --without-zlib.

    To build yaSSL with zlib support on Windows:

        1) download zlib from http://www.zlib.net/
        2) follow the instructions in zlib from projects/visualc6/README.txt
           for how to add the zlib project into the yaSSL workspace noting that
           you'll need to add configuration support for "Win32 Debug" and
           "Win32 Release" in note 3 under "To use:". 
        3) define HAVE_LIBZ when building yaSSL

--To build for libcurl on Linux, Solaris, *BSD, Mac OS X, or Cygwin:

  To build for libcurl the library needs to be built without C++ globals since
  the linker will be called in a C context, also libcurl configure will expect
  OpenSSL library names so some symbolic links are created.

    ./configure --enable-pure-c
    make
    make openssl-links

    (then go to your libcurl home and tell libcurl about yaSSL build dir)
    ./configure --with-ssl=/yaSSL-BuildDir LDFLAGS=-lm
    make


--To build for libcurl on Win32:

    Simply add the yaSSL project as a dependency to libcurl, add 
    yaSSL-Home\include and yaSSL-Home\include\openssl to the include list, and
    define USE_SSLEAY and USE_OPENSSL

    please email todd@yassl.com if you have any questions.

yassl Release notes, version 0.0.1

The first release of yassl supports normal RSA mode SSLv3 connections with
support for SHA-1 and MD5 digests.  Ciphers include DES, 3DES, and RC4.

yassl uses the CryptoPP library for cryptography, the source is available at
www.cryptopp.com .

yassl uses CML (the Certificate Management Library) for x509 support.  More
features will be in future versions.  The CML source is available for download
from www.digitalnet.com/knowledge/cml_home.htm .

The next release of yassl will support the 3 lesser-used SSL connection modes;
HandShake resumption, Ephemeral RSA (or DH), and Client Authentication as well
as full support for TLS.  Backwards support for SSLv2 is not planned at this
time.


**********************

Building yassl on linux:

use the ./buildall script to build everything.

buildall will configure and build CML, CryptoPP, and yassl.  Testing was 
preformed with gcc version 3.3.2 on kernel 2.4.22.


**********************

Building yassl on Windows:

Testing was preformed on Windows 2000 with Visual C++ 6 sp5.

1) decompress esnacc_r16.tgz in place, see buildall for syntax if unsure

2) decompress smp_r23.tgz in place

3) unzip cryptopp51/crypto51.zip in place

4) Build SNACC (part of CML) using snacc_builds.dsw in the SNACC directory

5) Build SMP (part of CMP) using smp.dsw in the smp directory

6) Build yassl using yassl.dsw


**********************

examples, server and client:

Please see the server and client examples in both versions to see how to link
to yassl and the support libraries.  On linux do 'make server' and 'make
client' to build them. On Windows you will find the example projects in the
main workspace, yassl.dsw.

The example server and client are compatible with openssl.


**********************

Building yassl into mysql on linux:

Testing was done using mysql version 4.0.17.

alter openssl_libs in the configure file, line 21056. Change '-lssl -lcrypto'
to '-lyassl -lcryptopp -lcmapi -lcmlasn -lctil -lc++asn1'.

see build/config_command for the configure command used to configure mysql
please change /home/touska/ to the relevant directory of course.

add yassl/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH because libmysql/conf_to_src does not
use the ssl lib directory though it does use the ssl libraries.

make

make install
