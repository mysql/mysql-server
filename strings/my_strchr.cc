  Calculate the length of the initial segment of 'str' which consists
  entirely of characters not in 'reject'.

  @param  cs              Pointer to charset info.
  @param  str             Pointer to multi-byte string.
  @param  str_end         Pointer to end of multi-byte string.
  @param  reject          Pointer to start of single-byte reject string.
  @param  reject_length   Length of single-byte reject string.

  @return Length of segment of multi-byte string that doesn't contain
          any character of the single-byte reject string or zero if an
          invalid encoding of a character of the multi-byte string is
          found.

  @note The reject string points to single-byte characters so it is
  only possible to find the first occurrence of a single-byte
  character.  Multi-byte characters in 'str' are treated as not
  matching any character in the reject string.
  This method returns zero if an invalid encoding of any character
  in the string 'str' using charset 'cs' is found.

  @todo should be moved to CHARSET_INFO if it's going to be called
  frequently.

  @internal The implementation builds on the assumption that 'str' is long,
  while 'reject' is short. So it compares each character in string
  with the characters in 'reject' in a tight loop over the characters
  in 'reject'.
