    Updated: 23 April 1984
    Defines: strend()

    strend(s) returns a character pointer to the NUL which ends s.  That
    is,  strend(s)-s  ==  strlen(s). This is useful for adding things at
    the end of strings.  It is redundant, because  strchr(s,'\0')  could
    be used instead, but this is clearer and faster.
