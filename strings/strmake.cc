    Defines: strmake()

    strmake(dst,src,length) moves length characters, or until end, of src to
    dst and appends a closing NUL to dst.
    Note that if strlen(src) >= length then dst[length] will be set to \0
    strmake() returns pointer to closing null

  /*
    'length' is the maximum length of the string; the buffer needs
    to be one character larger to accomodate the terminating '\0'.
    This is easy to get wrong, so we make sure we write to the
    entire length of the buffer to identify incorrect buffer-sizes.
    We only initialise the "unused" part of the buffer here, a) for
    efficiency, and b) because dst==src is allowed, so initialising
    the entire buffer would overwrite the source-string. Also, we
    write a character rather than '\0' as this makes spotting these
    problems in the results easier.
