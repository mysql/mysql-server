************************************************************

IMPORTANT:

Send bug (error) reports, questions and comments to the mailing list
at mysql@lists.mysql.com

Please use the 'mysqlbug' script when posting bug reports or questions
about MySQL. mysqlbug will gather some information about your system
and start your editor with a form in which you can describe your
problem. Bug reports might be silently ignored by the MySQL
maintainers if there is not a good reason included in the report as to
why mysqlbug has not been used. A report that says 'MySQL does not
work for me. Why?' is not consider a valid bug report.

The mysqlbug script can be found in the 'scripts' directory in the
distribution, that is 'there-you-installed-mysql/scripts'.
