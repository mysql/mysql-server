/*
 *  FILE
 *
 *	dbug.h	  user include file for programs using the dbug package
 *
 *  SYNOPSIS
 *
 *	#include <local/dbug.h>
 *
 *  SCCS ID
 *
 *	@(#)dbug.h	1.13 7/17/89
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Programs which use the dbug package must include this file.
 *	It contains the appropriate macros to call support routines
 *	in the dbug runtime library.
 *
 *	To disable compilation of the macro expansions define the
 *	preprocessor symbol "DBUG_OFF".  This will result in null
 *	macros expansions so that the resulting code will be smaller
 *	and faster.  (The difference may be smaller than you think
 *	so this step is recommended only when absolutely necessary).
 *	In general, tradeoffs between space and efficiency are
 *	decided in favor of efficiency since space is seldom a
 *	problem on the new machines).
 *
 *	All externally visible symbol names follow the pattern
 *	"_db_xxx..xx_" to minimize the possibility of a dbug package
 *	symbol colliding with a user defined symbol.
 *
 *	The DBUG_<N> style macros are obsolete and should not be used
 *	in new code.  Macros to map them to instances of DBUG_PRINT
 *	are provided for compatibility with older code.  They may go
 *	away completely in subsequent releases.

 *	      These macros provide a user interface into functions in the

 *
 *	      WARNING ---  Because the DBUG_ENTER macro allocates space on
 *	      the user function's stack, it must precede any executable
 *	      statements in the user function.
