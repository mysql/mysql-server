  MySQL Replication

  Replication is implemented via two types of threads:

    I/O Thread - One of these threads is started for each master server.
                 They maintain a connection to their master server, read log
                 events from the master as they arrive, and queues them into
                 a single, shared relay log file.  A Master_info represents
                 each of these threads.

    SQL Thread - One of these threads is started and reads from the relay log
                 file, executing each event. A Relay_log_info represents this
                 thread.

  Buffering in the relay log file makes it unnecessary to reread events from
  a master server across a slave restart.  It also decouples the slave from
  the master where long-running updates and event logging are concerned--ie
  it can continue to log new events while a slow query executes on the slave.

*****************************************************************************/

/*
  # MUTEXES in replication #

  JAG: TODO: This guide needs to be updated after pushing WL#10406!

  ## In Multisource_info (channel_map) ##

  ### m_channel_map_lock ###

  This rwlock is used to protect the multi source replication data structure
  (channel_map). Any operation reading contents from the channel_map should
  hold the rdlock during the operation. Any operation changing the
  channel_map (either adding/removing channels to/from the channel_map)
  should hold the wrlock during the operation.

  [init_replica() does not need it it's called early].

  ## In Master_info (mi) ##

  ### m_channel_lock ###

  It is used to SERIALIZE ALL administrative commands of replication: START
  SLAVE, STOP SLAVE, CHANGE MASTER, RESET SLAVE, delete_slave_info_objects
  (when mysqld stops)

  This thus protects us against a handful of deadlocks, being the know ones
  around lock_slave_threads and the mixed order they are acquired in some
  operations:

   + consider start_slave_thread() which, when starting the I/O thread,
     releases mi->run_lock, keeps rli->run_lock, and tries to re-acquire
     mi->run_lock.

   + Same applies to stop_slave() where a stop of the I/O thread will
     mi->run_lock, keeps rli->run_lock, and tries to re-acquire mi->run_lock.
     For the SQL thread, the order is the opposite.

  ### run_lock ###

  Protects all information about the running state: slave_running, thd
  and the existence of the I/O thread itself (to stop/start it, you need
  this mutex).
  Check the above m_channel_lock about locking order.

  ### data_lock ###

  Protects some moving members of the struct: counters (log name,
  position).

  ### sid_lock ###

  Protects the retrieved GTID set and it's SID map from updates.

  ## In Relay_log_info (rli) ##

  ### run_lock ###

  Same as Master_info's one. However, note that run_lock does not protect
  Relay_log_info.run_state. That is protected by data_lock.
  Check the above m_channel_lock about locking order.

  ### data_lock ###

  Protects some moving members of the struct: counters (log name,
  position).

  ## In MYSQL_BIN_LOG (mysql_bin_log,relay_log) ##

  ### LOCK_log ###

  This mutex should be taken when going to write to a log file. Notice that it
  does not prevent other threads from reading from the file being written (the
  "hot" file) or any other older file.

  ### LOCK_index ###

  This mutex should be taken when going to create/delete a log file (as those
  operations will update the .index file).

  ### LOCK_binlog_end_pos ###

  This mutex protects the access to the binlog_end_pos variable. The variable
  it set with the position that other threads reading from the currently active
  log file (the "hot" one) should not cross.

  ## Gtid_state (gtid_state, global_sid_map) ##

  ### global_sid_lock ###

  Protects all Gtid_state GTID sets (lost_gtids, executed_gtids,
  gtids_only_in_table, previous_gtids_logged, owned_gtids) and the global SID
  map from updates.

  The global_sid_lock must not be taken after LOCK_reset_gtid_table.

  ## Gtid_mode (gtid_mode) ##

  ### Gtid_mode::lock ###

  Used to arbitrate changes on server Gtid_mode.

  # Order of acquisition #

  Here, we list most major functions that acquire multiple locks.

  Notation: For each function, we list the locks it takes, in the
  order it takes them.  If a function holds lock A while taking lock
  B, then we write "A, B".  If a function locks A, unlocks A, then
  locks B, then we write "A | B".  If function F1 invokes function F2,
  then we write F2's name in parentheses in the list of locks for F1.

    Sys_var_gtid_mode::global_update:
      Gtid_mode::lock.wrlock, channel_map->wrlock, binlog.LOCK_log,
  global_sid_lock->wrlock

    change_master_cmd:
      channel_map.wrlock, (change_master)

    change_master:
      mi.channel_wrlock, mi.run_lock, rli.run_lock, (global_init_info),
  (purge_relay_logs), (init_relay_log_pos), rli.err_lock

    global_init_info:
      mi.data_lock, rli.data_lock

    purge_relay_logs:
      rli.data_lock, (relay_log.reset_logs)

    relay_log.reset_logs:
      .LOCK_log, .LOCK_index, .sid_lock->wrlock

    init_relay_log_pos:
      rli.data_lock

    queue_event:
      rli.LOCK_log, relay_log.sid_lock->rdlock, mi.data_lock

    stop_slave:
      channel_map rdlock,
      ( mi.channel_wrlock, mi.run_lock, thd.LOCK_thd_data
      | rli.run_lock, thd.LOCK_thd_data
      | relay.LOCK_log
      )

    start_slave:
      mi.channel_wrlock, mi.run_lock, rli.run_lock, rli.data_lock,
      global_sid_lock->wrlock

    mysql_bin_log.reset_logs:
      .LOCK_log, .LOCK_index, global_sid_lock->wrlock

    purge_relay_logs:
      rli.data_lock, (relay.reset_logs) THD::LOCK_thd_data,
      relay.LOCK_log, relay.LOCK_index, global_sid_lock->wrlock

    reset_master:
      (binlog.reset_logs) THD::LOCK_thd_data, binlog.LOCK_log,
      binlog.LOCK_index, global_sid_lock->wrlock, LOCK_reset_gtid_table

    reset_slave:
      mi.channel_wrlock, mi.run_lock, rli.run_lock, (purge_relay_logs)
      rli.data_lock, THD::LOCK_thd_data, relay.LOCK_log, relay.LOCK_index,
      global_sid_lock->wrlock

    purge_logs:
      .LOCK_index, LOCK_thd_list, thd.linfo.lock

      [Note: purge_logs contains a known bug: LOCK_index should not be
      taken before LOCK_thd_list.  This implies that, e.g.,
      purge_source_logs_to_file can deadlock with reset_master.  However,
      although purge_first_log and reset_slave take locks in reverse
      order, they cannot deadlock because they both first acquire
      rli.data_lock.]

    purge_source_logs_to_file, purge_source_logs_before_date, purge:
      (binlog.purge_logs) binlog.LOCK_index, LOCK_thd_list, thd.linfo.lock

    purge_first_log:
      rli.data_lock, relay.LOCK_index, rli.log_space_lock,
      (relay.purge_logs) LOCK_thd_list, thd.linfo.lock

    MYSQL_BIN_LOG::new_file_impl:
      .LOCK_log, .LOCK_index,
      ( [ if binlog: LOCK_prep_xids ]
      | global_sid_lock->wrlock
      )

    rotate_relay_log:
      (relay.new_file_impl) relay.LOCK_log, relay.LOCK_index

    kill_zombie_dump_threads:
      LOCK_thd_list, thd.LOCK_thd_data

    rli_init_info:
      rli.data_lock,
      ( relay.log_lock
      | global_sid_lock->wrlock
      | (relay.open_binlog)
      | (init_relay_log_pos) rli.data_lock, relay.log_lock
      )

  So the DAG of lock acquisition order (not counting the buggy
  purge_logs) is, empirically:

    Gtid_mode::lock, channel_map lock, mi.run_lock, rli.run_lock,
      ( rli.data_lock,
        ( LOCK_thd_list,
          (
            ( binlog.LOCK_log, binlog.LOCK_index
            | relay.LOCK_log, relay.LOCK_index
            ),
            ( rli.log_space_lock | global_sid_lock->wrlock )
          | binlog.LOCK_log, binlog.LOCK_index, LOCK_prep_xids
          | thd.LOCK_data
          )
        | mi.err_lock, rli.err_lock
        )
      )
    )
    | mi.data_lock, rli.data_lock
