/*
  Guilhem to Mats:
  in the table_mapping class, the memory is allocated and never freed (until
  destruction). So this is a good candidate for allocating inside a MEM_ROOT:
  it gives the efficient allocation in chunks (like in expand()). So I have
  introduced a MEM_ROOT.

  Note that inheriting from Sql_alloc had no effect: it has effects only when
  "ptr= new table_mapping" is called, and this is never called. And it would
  then allocate from thd->mem_root which is a highly volatile object (reset
  from example after executing each query, see dispatch_command(), it has a
  free_root() at end); as the table_mapping object is supposed to live longer
  than a query, it was dangerous.
  A dedicated MEM_ROOT needs to be used, see below.
