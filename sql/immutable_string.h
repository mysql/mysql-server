/**
 * @file
 *
 * ImmutableString defines a storage format for strings that is designed to be
 * as compact as possible, while still being reasonably fast to decode. There
 * are two variants; one with length, and one with a “next” pointer that can
 * point to another string. As the name implies, both are designed to be
 * immutable, i.e., they are not designed to be changed (especially not in
 * length) after being encoded. See the individual classes for more details.

/**
 * LinkedImmutableString is designed for storing rows (values) in hash join. It
 * does not need a length, since it is implicit from the contents; however,
 * since there might be multiple values with the same key, we simulate a
 * multimap by having a “next” pointer. (Normally, linked lists are a bad idea
 * due to pointer chasing, but here, we're doing so much work for each value
 * that the overhead disappears into the noise.)
 *
 * As the next pointer is usually be very close in memory to ourselves
 * (nearly all rows are stored in the same MEM_ROOT), we don't need to store
 * the entire pointer; instead, we store the difference between the start of
 * this string and the next pointer, as a zigzag-encoded Varint128. As with
 * the length in ImmutableStringWithLength, this typically saves 6–7 bytes
 * for each value. The special value of 0 means that there is no next pointer
 * (ie., it is nullptr), as that would otherwise be an infinite loop.
