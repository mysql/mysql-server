  @class ReplicatedColumnsView

  Since it's not mandatory that all fields in a TABLE object are replicated,
  this class extends Table_columns_view container and adds logic to filter out
  not needed columns.

  One active use-case relates to hidden generated columns. These type of
  columns are used to support functional indexes and are not meant to be
  replicated nor included in the serialization/deserialization of binlog
  events.
  @see ColumnFilterInboundFunctionalIndexes
  @see ColumnFilterOutboundFunctionalIndexes

  Another case relates to GIPKs, where the source or replica might contain a
  generated primary key that does not exist on the other side of the stream.
  In cases of differences in GIPK, the columns should be filtered out
  @see ColumnFilterInboundGipk

  This class allows for the use of other filters that can be added at any point.
