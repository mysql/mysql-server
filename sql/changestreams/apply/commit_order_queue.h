  Queue to maintain the ordered sequence of workers waiting for commit.

  The queue has a static list of elements, each one representing each worker
  commit information.

  The management of the order by which each worker will commit is implemented
  using:

  - A member variable pointing to the first worker to commit, the `head`.
  - A member variable pointing to the last worker to commit, the `tail`.
  - Each queue element holds a member variable that points to the next worker to
    commit, the `next`.
  - Pushing a new element will move the `tail`.
  - Popping an element will move the `head`.

  Atomics are used to make the queue thread-safe without the need for an
  explicit lock.
