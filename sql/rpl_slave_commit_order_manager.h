   Check if order commit deadlock happens.

   =============                     =============
   ...                               ...
   Engine acquires lock A
   ...                               Engine acquires lock A(waiting for
                                     trx1 to release it.
   COMMIT(waiting for
   trx2 to commit first).

   Currently, there are two corner cases can cause the deadlock.
   - Case 1
     CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT, INDEX(c2)) ENGINE = InnoDB;
     INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, NULL),(2, 2), (3, NULL), (4, 4), (5, NULL), (6, 6)

     INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(7, NULL);
     DELETE FROM t1 WHERE c2 <= 3;

   - Case 2
     ANALYZE TABLE t1;
     INSERT INTO t2 SELECT * FROM mysql.innodb_table_stats

   Since this is not a real lock deadlock, it could not be handled by engine.
   slave need to handle it separately.
   Worker1(trx1)                     Worker2(trx2)
   =============                     =============

   Engine acquires lock A
   ...                               Engine acquires lock A.
                                     1. found trx1 is holding the lock.)
                                     2. report the lock wait to server code by
                                        calling thd_report_row_lock_wait().
                                        Then this function is called to check
                                        if it causes a order commit deadlock.
                                        Report the deadlock to worker1.
                                     3. waiting for trx1 to release it.
   COMMIT(waiting for
   trx2 to commit first).
   Found the deadlock flag set
   by worker2 and then
   return with ER_LOCK_DEADLOCK.

   Rollback the transaction
                                    Get lock A and go ahead.
                                    ...
   Retry the transaction

   To conclude, The transaction A which is waiting for transaction B to commit
   and is holding a lock which is required by transaction B will be rolled back
   and try again later.
