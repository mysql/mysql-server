/**
  @file
  Definition of an undirected (join) hypergraph. A hypergraph in this context
  is an undirected graph consisting of nodes and hyperedges, where hyperedges
  are edges that can have more than one node in each side of the edge.
  For instance, in a graph with nodes {A, B, C, D}, a regular undirected edge
  could be e.g. (A,B), while in a hypergraph, an edge such as ({A,C},B) would
  also be allowed. Note that this definition of hypergraphs differs from that
  on Wikipedia.

  The main user of Hypergraph is subgraph_enumeration.h.

  // edges by testing the set of interesting nodes against the
  // “simple_neighborhood” bitmap.
  //
  // For optimization purposes, the edges are stored as if they were directed,
  // even though the hypergraph is fundamentally undirected. That is, a (u,v)
  // edge will be duplicated internally to (v,u), and the version that is posted
  // in a node's edge list is the one where the node itself is on the left side.
