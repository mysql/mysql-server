  Return a new item that is to be used after materialization (as given by
  items_to_copy). There are three main cases:

    1. The item isn't touched by materialization (e.g., because it's constant,
       or because we're not ready to compute it yet).
    2. The item is directly in the items_to_copy list, so it has its own field
       in the resulting temporary table; the corresponding new Item_field
       is returned.
    3. A _part_ of the item is in the items_to_copy list; e.g. say that we
       have an item (t1.x + 1), and t1.x is materialized into <temporary>.x.
       (In particular, this happens when having expressions that contain
       aggregate functions _and_ non-aggregates.) In this case, we go in and
       modify the item in-place, so that the appropriate sub-expressions are
       replaced; in this case, to (<temporary>.x + 1). This assumes that we
       never use the same item before and after a materialization in the
       query plan!
