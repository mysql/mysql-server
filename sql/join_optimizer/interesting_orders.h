  Tracks which tuple streams follow which orders, and in particular whether
  they follow interesting orders.

  An interesting order (and/or grouping) is one that we might need to sort by
  at some point during query execution (e.g. to satisfy an ORDER BY predicate);
  if the rows already are produced in that order, for instance because we
  scanned along the right index, we can skip the sort and get a lower cost.

  We generally follow these papers:

    [Neu04] Neumann and Moerkotte: “An efficient framework for order
      optimization”
    [Neu04b] Neumann and Moerkotte: “A Combined Framework for
      Grouping and Order Optimization”

  [Neu04b] is an updated version of [Neu04] that also deals with interesting
  groupings but omits some details to make more space, so both are needed.
  A combined and updated version of the same material is available in
  Moerkotte's “Query compilers” PDF.

  Some further details, like order homogenization, come from

    [Sim96] Simmen et al: “Fundamental Techniques for Order Optimization”

  All three papers deal with the issue of _logical_ orderings, where any
  row stream may follow more than one order simultaneously, as inferred
  through functional dependencies (FDs). For instance, if we have an ordering
  (ab) but also an active FD {a} → c (c is uniquely determined by a,
  for instance because a is a primary key in the same table as c), this means
  we also implicitly follow the orders (acb) and (abc). In addition,
  we trivially follow the orders (a), (ac) and (ab). However, note that we
  do _not_ necessarily follow the order (cab).

  Similarly, equivalences, such as WHERE conditions and joins, give rise
  to a stronger form of FDs. If we have an ordering (ab) and the FD b = c,
  we can be said to follow (ac), (acb) or (abc). The former would not be
  inferable from {b} → c and {c} → b alone. Equivalences with constants
  are perhaps even stronger, e.g. WHERE x=3 would give rise to {} → x,
  which could extend (a) to (xa), (ax) or (x).

  Neumann et al solve this by modelling which ordering we're following as a
  state in a non-deterministic finite state machine (NFSM). By repeatedly
  applying FDs (which become edges in the NFSM), we can build up all possible
  orderings from a base (which can be either the empty ordering, ordering from
  scanning along an index, or one produced by an explicit sort) and then
  checking whether we are in a state matching the ordering we are interested
  in. (There can be quite a bit of states, so we need a fair amount of pruning
  to keep the count manageable, or else performance will suffer.) Of course,
  since NFSMs are nondeterministic, a base ordering and a set of FDs can
  necessarily put us in a number of states, so we need to convert the NFSM
  to a DFSM (using the standard powerset construction for NFAs; see
  ConvertNFSMToDFSM()). This means that the ordering state for an access path
  is only a single integer, the DFSM state number. When we activate more FDs,
  for instance because we apply joins, we will move throughout the DFSM into
  more attractive states. By checking simple precomputed lookup tables,
  we can quickly find whether a given DFSM state follows a given ordering.

  The other kind of edges we follow are from the artificial starting state;
  they represent setting a specific ordering (e.g. because we sort by that
  ordering). This is set up in the NFSM and preserved in the DFSM.

  The actual collection of FDs and interesting orders happen outside this
  class, in the caller.

  A weakness in the approach is that transitive FDs are not always followed
  correctly. E.g., if we have an ordering (a), and FDs {a} → b and {b} → c,
  we will create (ab) and (abc), but _not_ (ac). This is not a problem for
  equivalences, though, and most of the FDs we collect are equivalences.
  We do have some heuristics to produce a new FD {a} → c where it is relevant,
  but they are not always effective.

  Neumann and Moerkotte distinguish between “tested-for” (O_T) and
  “producing” (O_P) orderings, where all orders are interesting but only
  some can be produced by explicit operators, such as sorts. Our implementation
  is exactly opposite; we allow every ordering to be produced (by means of
  sort-ahead), but there are orders that can be produced (e.g. when scanning
  an index) that are not interesting in themselves. Such orders can be
  pruned away early if we can show they do not produce anything interesting.


  The operations related to interesting orders, in particular the concept
  of functional dependencies, are related to the ones we are doing when
  checking ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY legality in sql/aggregate_check.h. However,
  there are some key differences as well:

   - Orderings are lexical, while groupings are just a bag of attributes.
     This increases the state space for orderings significantly; groupings
     can add elements at will and just grow the set freely, while orderings
     need more care. In particular, this means that groupings only need
     FDs on the form S → x (where S is a set), while orderings also benefit
     from those of the type x = y, which replace an element instead of
     adding a new one.

   - ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY is for correctness of rejecting or accepting the
     query, while interesting orders is just an optimization, so not
     recognizing rare cases is more acceptable.

   - ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY testing only cares about the set of FDs that hold
     at one specific point (GROUP BY testing, naturally), while interesting
     orders must be tracked throughout the entire operator tree. In particular,
     if using interesting orders for merge join, the status at nearly every
     join is relevant. Also, performance matters much more.

  Together, these mean that the code ends up being fairly different,
  and some cases are recognized by ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY but not by interesting
  orders. (The actual FD collection happens in BuildInterestingOrders in
  join_optimizer.cc; see the comment there for FD differences.)

  A note about nomenclature: Like Neumann et al, we use the term “ordering”
  (and “grouping”) instead of “order”, with the special exception of the
  already-established term “interesting order”.
