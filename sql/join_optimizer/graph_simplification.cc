/**
  Initialize a DAG containing all inferred join dependencies from the
  hypergraph. These are join dependencies that we cannot violate no matter
  what we do, so we need to make sure we do not try to force join reorderings
  that would be in conflict with them (whether directly or transitively) --
  and the returned OnlineCycleFinder allows us to check out exactly that,
  and also keep maintaining the DAG as we impose more orderings on the graph.

  This graph doesn't necessarily contain all dependencies inherent in the
  hypergraph, but it usually contains most of them. For instance, {t2,t3}-t4 is
  not a subjoin of t1-{t2,t4}, but must often be ordered before it anyway,
  since t2 and t4 are on opposite sides of the former join.
  See GraphSimplificationTest.IndirectHierarcicalJoins for a concrete test.

  Also, in the case of cyclic hypergraphs, the constraints in this DAG may be
  too strict, since it doesn't take into account that in cyclic hypergraphs we
  don't end up using all the edges (since the cycles are caused by redundant
  edges). So even if a constraint cannot be added because it would cause a cycle
  in the DAG, it doesn't mean that the hypergraph is unjoinable, because one of
  the edges involved in the cycle might be redundant and can be bypassed. See
  GraphSimplificationTest.CycleNeighboringHyperedges for a concrete test.

  We really ought to fix this, but it's not obvious how to implement it;
  it seems very difficult to create a test that catches all cases
  _and_ does not have any false positives in the presence of cycles
  (which often enable surprising orderings). Because it doesn't, we need
  additional and fairly expensive checks later on; see comments on
  GraphIsJoinable().

  and the authors were unaware that their assumed procedure did not cover
  all cases (Neumann, personal communication). Thus, we run this after
  each join simplification we apply, to see whether we created such a
  contradiction (if so, we know the opposite ordering is true).

  The algorithm is bare-bones: We put each node (table) into its own

  those components into larger components. If we can apply enough edges
  (by repeated application of the entire list) that everything is connected

  Repeatedly apply simplifications (in the order of most to least safe) to the
  given hypergraph, until it is below “subgraph_pair_limit” subgraph pairs
  or we can simplify it no more. Since we cannot know ahead of time exactly
  how many simplification steps required, we need to do this iteratively,
  running DPhyp (with all the actual and expensive costing removed, only
  subgraph pair counting) as we go.

  On the assumption that running DPhyp over the graph is significantly more
  expensive than applying a simplification step, we do this by means of binary
  search (what the paper calls “the full algorithm”). We apply first 1, 2, 4,
  8, 16, etc. steps until we find a number that takes us below the limit.
  Then, we apply a simple binary search between that value and the previous one.
  Once we find the border between too complicated and just simple enough,
  we set the graph to the latter, and the actual query planning will start
  afresh.
