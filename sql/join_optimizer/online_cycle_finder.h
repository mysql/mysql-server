/**
  A fast online cycle finder, based on [Pea03]. It keeps a DAG in memory,
  built up incrementally, and is able to reject adding edges that would create
  cycles (or, equivalently, test if adding an edge would create a cycle).
  The amortized cost of checking ϴ(E) insertions is O(V).

  The basic working of the algorithm is to keep a list of all vertices,
  topologically sorted given the order so far. When inserting a new edge,
  we can quickly identify any vertices that would need to be moved in the
  topological sort (they are the ones stored between the two endpoints),
  run a DFS, and see if moving them would cause a contradiction (and thus,
  a cycle). See EdgeWouldCreateCycle() or the paper for more details.

  Note that confusingly enough, when used from the graph simplification
  algorithm, the vertices in this graph represent hyperedges (joins) in the join
  hypergraph, _not_ the vertices (tables) themselves. The edges in this graph
  are happens-before relations between those joins.

  Pointer Analysis”, section 3.2.
