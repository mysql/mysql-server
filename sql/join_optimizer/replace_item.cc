/**
  Check what field the given item will be materialized into under the given
  temporary table parameters.

  If the item is materialized (ie., found in items_to_copy), we return a
  canonical Item_field for that field; ie., the same every time. This means
  that you can do the same replacement in a SELECT list and then in
  items_to_copy itself, and still have them match. This is used in particular
  when updating Temp_table_param itself, in FinalizePlanForQueryBlock().

  Normally, we want to search for only the same item, up to references
  (need_exact_match=true). However, in ORDER BY specifications of windows,
  we can sometimes have the same field referred to by different Item_field,
  and the callers may need to set need_exact_match=false, which compares
  using Item::eq() instead. This also disables the behavior of checking
  and propagating Item::hidden.
