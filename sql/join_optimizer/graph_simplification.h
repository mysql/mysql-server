/**

  Heuristic simplification of query graphs to make them execute faster,
  largely a direct implementation of [Neu09] (any references to just
  “the paper” will generally be to that). This is needed for when
  query hypergraphs have too many possible (connected) subgraphs to
  evaluate all of them, and we need to resort to heuristics.

  The algorithm works by evaluating pairs of neighboring joins
  (largely, those that touch some of the same tables), finding obviously _bad_
  pairwise orderings and then disallowing them. I.e., if join A must
  very likely happen before join B (as measured by cost heuristics),
  we disallow the B-before-A join by extending the hyperedge of
  B to include A's nodes. This makes the graph more visually complicated
  (thus making “simplification” a bit of a misnomer), but reduces the search
  space, so that the query generally is faster to plan.

  Obviously, as the algorithm is greedy, it will sometimes make mistakes
  and make for a more expensive (or at least higher-cost) query.
  This isn't necessarily an optimal or even particularly good algorithm;
  e.g. LinDP++ [Rad19] claims significantly better results, especially
  on joins that are 40 tables or more. However, using graph simplification
  allows us to handle large queries reasonably well, while still reusing nearly
  all of our query planning machinery (i.e., we don't have to implement a
  separate query planner and cost model for large queries).

  Also note that graph simplification only addresses the problem of subgraph
  pair explosion. If each subgraph pair generates large amounts of candidate
  access paths (e.g. through parameterized paths), each subgraph pair will in
  itself be expensive, and graph simplification does not concern itself with
  this at all. Thus, to get a complete solution, we must _also_ have heuristic
  pruning of access paths within a subgraph, which we're currently missing.
