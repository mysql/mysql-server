/**
  A very simple receiver to be used with DPhyp; all it does is
  to keep track of which subgraphs it has seen (which is required
  for the algorithm to test connectedness), count them, and stop
  if we reach a given limit.

  This is usable both from unit tests (although we don't actually
  currently use it for such) and for making a cheap test of whether
  the number of subgraph pairs is below a given limit; see GraphSimplifier
  for the latter. (The graph simplification paper, [Neu09], mentions
  running a special mode where we don't check for subgraph complements
  at all, only connected subgraphs, but we haven't investigated
  to what degree this would be possible for our implementation,
  or whether it would be advantageous at all.)
