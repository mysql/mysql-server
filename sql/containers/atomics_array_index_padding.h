  Indexing provider that pads each of the array elements to the size of the
  CPU cache line, in order to avoid false sharing and cache misses.

  In terms of the array size, this indexing provider will use force the use
  of more memory than the needed to store the array elements of type
  `T`. If the array is of size `n`, then instead of the allocated memory
  being `n * sizeof(std::atomic<T>)`, it will be of size `n *
  cache_line_size`. Since, typically, in modern systems, the cache line
  size is 64 or 128 bytes, that would be an increase in the allocated
  memory.

  This class translates element-to-byte indexing as if each element is
  aligned with the size of the CPU cache line. The CPU cache line size is
  calculated at runtime.
