/**
  Lock-free, fixed-size bounded, multiple-producer (MP), multiple-consumer
  (MC), circular FIFO queue for integral elements.

  Monotonically ever increasing virtual indexes are used to keep track of
  the head and tail pointer for the size-bounded circular queue. Virtual
  indexes are translated into memory indexes by calculating the remainder
  of the integer division of the virtual index by the queue capacity. The
  maximum value of a virtual index is 2^63 - 1.

  Head is the pointer to the virtual index of the first position that holds
  an element to be popped, if any.

  Tail is the pointer to the virtual index of the first available position
  to push an element to, if any.

  Template parameters are as follows:
  - `T`: The integral type for the queue elements.
  - `Null`: Value of type `T`, that will be used to mark a queue position
            as empty.
  - `Erased`: Value of type `T`, that will be used to mark an queue
              position as erased.
  - `I`: Type of indexing to be used by the underlying array in the form of
         a class. Available classes are `container::Padded_indexing` and
         `container::Interleaved_indexing`, check the classes documentation
         for further details. The parameter defaults to
         `container::Padded_indexing`.
  - `A`: Type of memory allocator to be used, in the form of a class
         (defaults to no allocator).

  All the available operations are thread-safe, in the strict sense of no
  memory problems rise from multiple threads trying to perform operations
  concurrently.

  However, being a lock-free structure, the queue may be changing at the
  same time as operations access both pointers and values or a client of
  the API evaluates the result of the invoked operation. The operation
  results and returning states are always based on the thread local view of
  the queue state, which may be safe or unsafe to proceed with the given
  operation. Therefore, extra validations, client-side serialization and/or
  retry mechanisms may be needed while using the queue operations.

  Available methods are:
  - `pop`: if the head of the queue points to a virtual index different
           from the one pointed by the tail of the queue, removes the
           element pointed to by the head of the queue, points the head to
           the next virtual index and returns the retrieved value. If head
           and tail of the queue point to the same virtual index, the queue
           is empty, `Null` is returned and the thread operation state is
           set to `NO_MORE_ELEMENTS`.
  - `push`: if the tail of the queue points to a virtual index different
            from the one pointed by head-plus-queue-capacity, sets the
            position pointed by tail with the provided element and points
            the tail to the next virtual index. If tail and head plus queue
            capacity point to the same virtual index, the queue is full, no
            operation is performed and the thread operation state is set to
            `NO_SPACE_AVAILABLE`.
  - `capacity`: maximum number of elements allowed to coexist in the queue.
  - `head`: pointer to the virtual index of the first available element, if
            any.
  - `tail`: pointer to the virtual index of the first available position to
            add an element to. Additionally, the value returned by `tail()`
            can also give an lower-than approximation of the total amount
            of elements already pushed into the queue -in between reading
            the virtual index tail is pointing to and evaluating it, some
            more elements may have been pushed.
  - `front`: the first available element. If none, `Null` is returned.
  - `back`: the last available element. If none, `Null` is returned.
  - `clear`: sets all positions of the underlying array to `Null` and
             resets the virtual index pointed to by both the head and the
             tail of the queue to `0`.
  - `is_empty`: whether or not the head and tail of the queue point to the
                same virtual index.
  - `is_full`: whether or not the tail and head-plus-queue-capacity point
               to the same virtual index.
  - `erase_if`: traverses the queue, starting at the queue relative memory
                index 0, stopping at the relative memory index
                `capacity() - 1` and invoking the passed-on predicate over each
                position value, while disregarding positions that have
                `Null` or `Erased` values.

  Note that, if `Null` and `Erased` hold the same value, the resulting class
        will not include the `erase_if` method.

    Iterator helper class to iterate over the queue staring at the virtual
    index pointed to by the head, up until the virtual index pointed to by
    the tail.

    Being an iterator over a lock-free structure, it will not be
    invalidated upon queue changes since operations are thread-safe and no
    invalid memory access should stem from iterating over and changing the
    queue, simultaneously.

    However, the following possible iteration scenarios, not common in
    non-thread-safe structures, should be taken into consideration and
    analysed while using standard library features that use the `Iterator`
    requirement, like `for_each` loops, `std::find`, `std::find_if`, etc:

    a) The iteration never stops because there is always an element being
       pushed before the queue `end()` method is invoked.

    b) The iterator points to `Null` values at the beginning of the
       iteration because elements were popped just after the queue `begin()`
       method is invoked.

    c) The iterator points to `Null` or `Erased` in between pointing to
       values different from `Null` or `Erased`.

    d) The iterator may point to values that do not correspond to the
       virtual index being held by the iterator, in the case of the amount
       of both pop and push operations between two iteration loops was
       higher then the queue `capacity()`.

    If one of the above scenarios is harmful to your use-case, an
    additional serialization mechanism may be needed to iterate over the
    queue. Or another type of structure may be more adequate.

    Check C++ documentation for the definition of `Iterator` named
    requirement for more information.
