/**
  On a replica and only on a replica, this class is responsible for
  committing the applied transactions in the same order as was observed on
  the source.

  The key components of the commit order management are:
  - This class, that wraps the commit order management, allowing for API
    clients to schedule workers for committing, make workers wait for their
    turn to commit, finish up a scheduled worker task and allow for others
    to progress.
  - A commit order queue of type `cs::apply::Commit_order_queue` that holds
    the sequence by which worker threads should commit and the committing
    order state for each of the scheduled workers.
  - The MDL infra-structure which allows for: one worker to wait for
    another to finish when transactions need to be committed in order;
    detect deadlocks involving workers waiting on each other for their turn
    to commit and non-worker threads waiting on meta-data locks held by
    worker threads.

  The worker thread progress stages relevant to the commit order management
  are:
  - REGISTERED: the worker thread as been added to the commit order queue
    by the coordinator and is allowed to start applying the transaction.
  - FINISHED APPLYING: the worker thread just finished applying the
    transaction and checks if it needs to wait for a preceding worker to
    finish committing.
  - REQUESTED GRANT: the worker thread waits on the MDL graph for the
    preceding worker to finish committing.
  - WAITED: the worker thread finished waiting (either is the first in the
    commit order queue or has just been grantted permission to continue).
  - RELEASE NEXT: the worker thread removes itself from the commit order
    queue, checks if there is any worker waiting on the commit order and
    releases such worker iff is the preceding worker for the waiting
    worker.
  - FINISHED: the worker marks itself as available to take on another
    transaction to apply.

  The progress of the worker within the stages:

  Lock-free structures and atomic access to variables are used to manage
  the commit order queue and to keep the worker stage transitions. This
  means that there is no atomicity in regards to changes performed in the
  queue or in the MDL graph within a given stage. Hence, stages maybe
  skipped and sequentially scheduled worker threads may overlap in the
  same stage.

  In the context of the following tables, let W1 be a worker that is
  scheduled to commit before some other worker W2.

  The behavior of W2 (rows) towards W1 (columns) in regards to
  thread synchronization, based on the stage of each thread:
+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
|     \   W1 | REGISTERED | FINISHED | REQUESTED | WAITED | RELEASE | FINISHED |
| W2   \     |            | APPLYING |   GRANT   |        |  NEXT   |          |
+------------+------------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+----------+
| REGISTERED |            |          |           |        |         |          |
+------------+------------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+----------+
| FIN. APPL. |            |          |           |        |         |          |
+------------+------------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+----------+
| REQ. GRANT |    WAIT    |   WAIT   |   WAIT    |  WAIT  |  WAIT   |          |
+------------+------------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+----------+
| WAITED     |            |          |           |        |         |          |
+------------+------------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+----------+
| REL. NEXT  |            |          |           |        |  WAIT   |          |
+------------+------------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+----------+
| FINISHED   |            |          |           |        |         |          |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  The W2 wait when both worker threads are in the RELEASE NEXT stage
  happens in the case W2 never entered the REQUESTED GRANT stage. This case
  may happen if W1 being in RELEASE NEXT removes itself from the queue
  before W2 enters FINISHED APPLYING and then W2 reaches the RELEASE NEXT
  stage before W1 exits it:

             [W1]                                [W2]

     stage = RELEASE NEXT                 stage = REGISTERED
               |                                  |
               v                                  |
          queue.pop()                             v
               |                     stage = FINISHED_APPLYING
               |                                  |
               v                                  v
     next_worker.stage                   queue.front() == W2
        == FINISHED_APPLYING                      |
               |                                  |
               |                                  v
               |                           stage = WAITED
               |                                  |
               |                                  v
               |                          stage = RELEASE NEXT
               |                                  |
               v                                  v
     next_worker.release()                   queue.pop()

  The commit order queue includes mechanisms that block the popping until
  the preceding worker finishes the releasing operation. This wait will
  only be active for the amount of time that takes for W1 to change the
  values of the MDL graph structures needed to release W2, which is a very
  small amount of cycles.

  The behavior of W1 (rows) towards W2 (columns)in regards to thread
  synchronization, based on the stage of each thread:
+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
|     \   W2 | REGISTERED | FINISHED | REQUESTED | WAITED | RELEASE | FINISHED |
| W1   \     |            | APPLYING |   GRANT   |        |  NEXT   |          |
+------------+------------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+----------+
| REGISTERED |            |          |           |        |         |          |
+------------+------------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+----------+
| FIN. APPL. |            |          |           |        |         |          |
+------------+------------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+----------+
| REQ. GRANT |            |          |           |        |         |          |
+------------+------------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+----------+
| WAITED     |            |          |           |        |         |          |
+------------+------------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+----------+
| REL. NEXT  |            |  GRANT   |   GRANT   |        |         |          |
+------------+------------+----------+-----------+--------+---------+----------+
| FINISHED   |            |          |           |        |         |          |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  The W1 grant to W2 may happen when W2 is either in the FINISHED APPLYING
  or REQUESTED GRANT stages. W1 must also signal the grant when W2 is in
  FINISHED APPLYING because W1 has no way to determine if W2 has already
  evaluated the first element of the queue or not, that is, W1 can't
  determine if W2 will proceed to the REQUESTED GRANT or to the WAITED
  stage. Therefore, W1 will signal in both cases.
