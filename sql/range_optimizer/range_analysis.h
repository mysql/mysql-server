  RangeAnalysisModule
    A module that accepts a condition, index (or partitioning) description,
    and builds lists of intervals (in index/partitioning space), such that
    all possible records that match the condition are contained within the
    intervals.
    The entry point for the range analysis module is get_mm_tree()
    (mm=min_max) function.

    The lists are returned in form of complicated structure of interlinked
    SEL_TREE/SEL_IMERGE/SEL_ROOT/SEL_ARG objects.
    See quick_range_seq_next, find_used_partitions for examples of how to walk
    this structure.
    All direct "users" of this module are located within this file, too.
