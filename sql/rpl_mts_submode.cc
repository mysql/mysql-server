   The successful search results in a pair of a logical timestamp value and a

   headway scanning of GAQ from a point of a previous search's stop position

   Staleness is caused by GAQ garbage collection that increments the rhs of (*),

   restarting from the queue tail.

   Since the lwm's exact value is not always available its pessimistic

   Consequently when GAQ consists of just one item there's none to wait.
