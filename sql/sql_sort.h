/*
   The structure SORT_ADDON_FIELD describes a fixed layout
   for field values appended to sorted values in records to be sorted
   in the sort buffer.
   Only fixed layout is supported now.
   Null bit maps for the appended values is placed before the values 
   themselves. Offsets are from the last sorted field, that is from the
   record referefence, which is still last component of sorted records.
   It is preserved for backward compatiblility.
   The structure is used tp store values of the additional fields 
   in the sort buffer. It is used also when these values are read
   from a temporary file/buffer. As the reading procedures are beyond the
   scope of the 'filesort' code the values have to be retrieved via
   the callback function 'unpack_addon_fields'.
