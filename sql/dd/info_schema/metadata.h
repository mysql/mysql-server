  The version of the current information_schema system views.

  This version number is stored on disk in the data dictionary.
  Every time the information_schema structure changes,
  this version number must change.

  The numbering to use is the MySQL version number
  of the first MySQL version that published a given database schema.
  The format is Mmmdd with M=Major, m=minor, d=dot,
  so that MySQL 8.0.4 is encoded as 80004.

  Historical I_S version number published:

  1: Published in 8.0.3-RC.
  ------------------------
  Introduced in MySQL 8.0.0 by WL#6599. Never published in a GA version.

  80011: Published in 8.0 GA.
  ------------------------------------
  Changes from version 1:

  - Bug#27309116: Add a new column `external_language` to `mysql`.`routines`
    and update `information_schema`.`routines` to reflect this column.

  - Bug#27593348: INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STATISTICS FIELD TYPE CHANGE.
    Changes the column I_S.STATISTICS.NON_UNIQUE type from VARCHAR
    to INT.

  80012: Current
  ------------------------------------
  Changes from version 80011:

  - Bug#27945704 UNABLE TO JOIN TABLE_CONSTRAINTS AND REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS
    Changes the collation of I_S columns that project index name and
    constraint name to use utf8_tolower_ci.

  - WL#11864 Implement I_S.VIEW_TABLE_USAGE and I_S.VIEW_ROUTINE_USAGE

  - WL#1075 adds one column to INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STATISTICS: "EXPRESSION".
    This column prints out the expression for functional key parts, or SQL NULL
    if it is a regular key part. For functional key parts, COLUMN_NAME is set to
    SQL NULL.
