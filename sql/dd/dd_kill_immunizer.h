  RAII class for immunizing the THD from kill operations.

  Interruptions to operations on new Data Dictionary tables due to KILL QUERY,
  KILL CONNECTION or statement execution timeout would leave DD in inconsistent
  state. So the operations on the New Data Dictionary tables are made immune to
  these operations using DD_kill_immunizer.

  Note:
    DD operations are made immune to KILL operations till WL#7743 and WL#7016
    are implemented. So as part of these WL's DD_kill_immunizer should be
    removed.
