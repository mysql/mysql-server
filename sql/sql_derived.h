/**
  Class which handles pushing conditions down to a materialized derived
  table. In Query_block::prepare, if it is the outermost query block, and
  if we are at the end of preparation, a WHERE condition from the query
  block is checked to see if it can be pushed to the materialized derived
  table.
  Query_block::prepare
  push_conditions_to_derived_tables()
    For every materialized derived table,
    If there is a where condition in this query block,
      Make condition that can be pushed down to the derived table.
        Extract a part of the condition that has columns belonging to only
        this derived table.
        Check if this condition can be pushed past window functions if any to
        the HAVING clause of the derived table.
          Make a condition that could not be pushed past. This will remain in
          the outer query block.
        Check if this condition can be pushed past group by if present to the
        WHERE clause of the derived table.
          Make a condition that could not be pushed past. This will be part of
          the HAVING clause of the derived table query.
      Get the remainder condition which could not be pushed to the derived
      table.
      Push the condition down to derived table's query expression.
      REPEAT THE ABOVE for the rest of the derived tables.
   For every query expression inside the current query block
     REPEAT THE ABOVE to keep pushing as far down as possible.
