  Recovers from last crashed binlog at server start.

  After a crash, storage engines may contain transactions that are prepared
  but not committed (in theory any engine, in practice InnoDB).  This
  classe's methods use the binary log as the source of truth to determine
  which of these transactions should be committed and which should be
  rolled back.

  The `Binlog::recovery()` method collects the following from the last
  available binary log:
  - the list of internally coordinated transactions (normal) that are
    completely written to the binary log.
  - the list of externally coordinated transactions (XA) that appear in the
    binary log, along the state those transactions are in.

  The list of XIDs of all internally coordinated transactions that are
  completely written to the binary log is passed to the storage engines
  through the ha_recover function in the handler interface. This tells the
  storage engines to commit all prepared transactions that are in the set,
  and to roll back all prepared transactions that are not in the set.

  The list of XIDs of all externally coordinated transactions that appear
  in the binary log, along with the state they are in, is passed to the
  storage engines through the ha_recover function in the handler
  interface. The storage engine will determine if the transaction is to be
  kept at PREPARE, is to be COMMITTED or ROLLED BACK, in accordance with:
  the state that is provided in the list; the internal storage engine state
  for the transaction.
