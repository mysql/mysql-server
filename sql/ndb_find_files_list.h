/**
  Ndb_find_files_list

  Utility class which encapsulates the find_files() function
  and its returned list of files.

  The find_files() function return a list consisting of
  pointers to file names, the file names themself are allocated
  in a specified MEM_ROOT. In order to avoid that the default
  MEM_ROOT of the caller is used, this class allocates a memory
  root which holds the file name pointers and the file name strings
  until the list goes out of scope.

  The find_files() function also has a special quirk in that
  it looks at the THD::col_access member variable to determine which
  files and directories the caller has permission to see. This class
  make sure that caller has full access to see all files by applying
  the proper values for THD::col_access(see inline comment below).
