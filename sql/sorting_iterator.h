  An adapter that takes in another RowIterator and produces the same rows,
  just in sorted order. (The actual sort happens in Init().) Unfortunately, it
  is still bound to working off a TABLE object, which means that you can't
  use it to e.g. sort the output of a join without materializing into a
  temporary table first (ignoring that we currently have no Iterators for
  joins).

  The primary reason for this is that we currently have no way of communicating
  read sets through Iterators, and SortingIterator needs to add fields used in
  ORDER BY to the read set for the appropriate tables. This could be mitigated
  by e.g. sending in an unordered_set<Field *>, but we don't currently have
  such a mechanism.
