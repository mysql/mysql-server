/**
  A wrapper class around the buffer used by filesort().
  The buffer is a contiguous chunk of memory,
  where the first part is <num_records> pointers to the actual data.

  We wrap the buffer in order to be able to do lazy initialization of the
  pointers: the buffer is often much larger than what we actually need.

  The buffer must be kept available for multiple executions of the
  same sort operation, so we have explicit allocate and free functions,
  rather than doing alloc/free in CTOR/DTOR.
