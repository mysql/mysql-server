/**
  A wrapper class around the buffer used by filesort().
  The sort buffer is a contiguous chunk of memory,
  containing both records to be sorted, and pointers to said records:

  <start of buffer       | still unused   |                      end of buffer>
  |rec 0|record 1  |rec 2|  ............  |ptr to rec2|ptr to rec1|ptr to rec0|

  Records will be inserted "left-to-right". Records are not necessarily
  fixed-size, they can be packed and stored without any "gaps".

  Record pointers will be inserted "right-to-left", as a side-effect
  of inserting the actual records.

  We wrap the buffer in order to be able to do lazy initialization of the
  pointers: the buffer is often much larger than what we actually need.

  With this allocation scheme, and lazy initialization of the pointers,
  we are able to pack variable-sized records in the buffer,
  and thus possibly have space for more records than we initially estimated.

  The buffer must be kept available for multiple executions of the
  same sort operation, so we have explicit allocate and free functions,
  rather than doing alloc/free in CTOR/DTOR.
