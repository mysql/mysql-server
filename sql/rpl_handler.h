  Variable to keep the value set for the
  `replication_optimize_for_static_plugin_config` global.

  When this global variable value is set to `1`, we prevent all plugins that
  register replication observers to be unloaded until the variable is set to
  `0`, again. While the value of the variable is `1`, we are also exchanging the
  `Delegate` class read-write lock by an atomic-based shared spin-lock.

  This behaviour is useful for increasing the throughtput of the master when a
  large number of slaves is connected, by preventing the acquisition of the
  `LOCK_plugin` mutex and using a more read-friendly lock in the `Delegate`
  class, when invoking the observer's hooks.

  Note that a large number of slaves means a large number of dump threads, which
  means a large number of threads calling the registered observers hooks.

  If `UNINSTALL` is executed on a replication observer plugin while the variable
  is set to `1`, the unload of the plugin will be deferred until the variable's
  value is set to `0`.
