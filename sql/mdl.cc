    @note The fact that we use read-write lock prefers readers here is

          For example, imagine that we have following waiters graph:

                       ctxA -> obj1 -> ctxB -> obj1 -|
                        ^                            |

          and both ctxA and ctxB start deadlock detection process:

            ctxA read-locks obj1             ctxB read-locks obj2
            ctxA goes deeper                 ctxB goes deeper

          Now ctxC comes in who wants to start waiting on obj1, also
          ctxD comes in who wants to start waiting on obj2.

            ctxC tries to write-lock obj1   ctxD tries to write-lock obj2
            ctxC is blocked                 ctxD is blocked

          Now ctxA and ctxB resume their search:

            ctxA tries to read-lock obj2    ctxB tries to read-lock obj1

          If m_rwlock prefers writes (or fair) both ctxA and ctxB would be
          blocked because of pending write locks from ctxD and ctxC
          correspondingly. Thus we will get a deadlock in deadlock detector.
          If m_wrlock prefers readers (actually ignoring pending writers is
          enough) ctxA and ctxB will continue and no deadlock will occur.

  Compatibility (or rather "incompatibility") matrices for scoped metadata
  lock. Arrays of bitmaps which elements specify which granted/waiting locks
  are incompatible with type of lock being requested.

  Here is how types of individual locks are translated to type of scoped lock:

    ----------------+-------------+
    Type of request | Correspond. |
    for indiv. lock | scoped lock |
    ----------------+-------------+
    S, SH, SR, SW   |   IS        |
    SNW, SNRW, X    |   IX        |
    SNW, SNRW -> X  |   IX (*)    |

  The first array specifies if particular type of request can be satisfied
  if there is granted scoped lock of certain type.

             | Type of active   |
     Request |   scoped lock    |
      type   | IS(**) IX   S  X |
    ---------+------------------+
    IS       |  +      +   +  + |
    IX       |  +      +   -  - |
    S        |  +      -   +  - |
    X        |  +      -   -  - |

  The second array specifies if particular type of request can be satisfied
  if there is already waiting request for the scoped lock of certain type.
  I.e. it specifies what is the priority of different lock types.

             |    Pending      |
     Request |  scoped lock    |
      type   | IS(**) IX  S  X |
    ---------+-----------------+
    IS       |  +      +  +  + |
    IX       |  +      +  -  - |
    S        |  +      +  +  - |
    X        |  +      +  +  + |

  Here: "+" -- means that request can be satisfied
        "-" -- means that request can't be satisfied and should wait

  (*)   Since for upgradable locks we always take intention exclusive scoped
        lock at the same time when obtaining the shared lock, there is no
        need to obtain such lock during the upgrade itself.
  (**)  Since intention shared scoped locks are compatible with all other
        type of locks we don't even have any accounting for them.

    member are updated by different threads when the lock is granted
    (see MDL_context::acquire_lock() and MDL_lock::reschedule_waiters()).
    As a result, here we may encounter a situation when MDL_lock data
    already reflects the fact that the lock was granted but
    m_waiting_for member has not been updated yet.

    For example, imagine that:

    thread1: Owns SNW lock on table t1.
    thread2: Attempts to acquire SW lock on t1,
             but sees an active SNW lock.
             Thus adds the ticket to the waiting queue and
             sets m_waiting_for to point to the ticket.
    thread1: Releases SNW lock, updates MDL_lock object to
             grant SW lock to thread2 (moves the ticket for
             SW from waiting to the active queue).
             Attempts to acquire a new SNW lock on t1,
             sees an active SW lock (since it is present in the
             active queue), adds ticket for SNW lock to the waiting
             queue, sets m_waiting_for to point to this ticket.

    At this point deadlock detection algorithm run by thread1 will see that:
    - Thread1 waits for SNW lock on t1 (since m_waiting_for is set).
    - SNW lock is not granted, because it conflicts with active SW lock
      owned by thread 2 (since ticket for SW is present in granted queue).
    - Thread2 waits for SW lock (since its m_waiting_for has not been
      updated yet!).
    - SW lock is not granted because there is pending SNW lock from thread1.
      Therefore deadlock should exist [sic!].

    To avoid detection of such false deadlocks we need to check the "actual"
    status of the ticket being waited for, before analyzing its blockers.
    We do this by checking the wait status of the context which is waiting
    for it. To avoid races this has to be done under protection of
    MDL_lock::m_rwlock lock.
