/**
  Session_sysvar_resource_manager
  -------------------------------
  When a session (THD) gets initialized, it receives a shallow copy of all
  global system variables.
  thd->variables= global_system_variables; (see plugin_thdvar_init())

  In case of Sys_var_charptr variables, we need to maintain a separate copy for
  each session though so that global and session variables can be altered
  independently.

  This class is responsible for alloc|dealloc-ating memory for Sys_var_charptr
  variables for every session. It works in three steps :

  (1) init :
        Creates a copy (memdup()) of global Sys_var_charptr system variable for
        the respective session variable (passed as a  parameter) & inserts it
        into sysvar_string_alloc_hash (containing the alloced address) to infer
        that memory has been allocated for the session. init() is called during
        the initialization of session system variables. (plugin_thdvar_init())
  (2) update :
        When the session variable is updated, the old memory is freed and new
        memory is allocated to hold the new value. The corresponding member in
        sysvar_string_alloc_hash is also updated to hold the new alloced memory
        address. (Sys_var_charptr::session_update())
  (3) deinit :
        Its a one-shot operation to free all the session Sys_var_charptr system
        variables. It basically traverses down the sysvar_string_alloc_hash
        hash and calls free() for all the addresses that it holds.

  Note, there should always be at most one node per Sys_var_charptr session
  system variable.
