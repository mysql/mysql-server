/**
  Class to store all the Master_info objects of a slave
  to access them in the replication code base or performance
  schema replication tables.

  In a Multisourced replication setup, a slave connects
  to several masters (also called as sources). This class
  stores the Master_infos where each Master_info belongs
  to a slave.

  The important objects for a slave are the following:
  i) Master_info and Relay_log_info (slave_parallel_workers == 0)
  ii) Master_info, Relay_log_info and Slave_worker(slave_parallel_workers >0 )

  Master_info is always assosiated with a Relay_log_info per channel.
  So, it is enough to store Master_infos and call the corresponding
  Relay_log_info by mi->rli;

  This class is not yet thread safe. Any part of replication code that
  calls this class member function should always lock the channel_map.

  Only a single global object for a server instance should be created.

  The two important data structures in this class are
  i) C++ std map to store the Master_info pointers with channel name as a key.
    These are the base channel maps.
    @TODO: convert to boost after it's introduction.
  ii) C++ std map to store the channel maps with a channel type as its key.
      This map stores slave channel maps, group replication channels or others
  iii) An array of Master_info pointers to access from performance schema
     tables. This array is specifically implemented in a way to make
      a) pfs indices simple i.e a simple integer counter
      b) To avoid recalibration of data structure if master info is deleted.
         * Consider the following high level implementation of a pfs table
            to make a row.
          <pseudo_code>
          highlevel_pfs_funciton()
          {
           while(replication_table_xxxx.rnd_next())
           {
             do stuff;
           }
          }
         </pseudo_code>
         However, we lock channel_map lock for every rnd_next(); There is a gap
         where an addition/deletion of a channel would rearrange the map
         making the integer indices of the pfs table point to a wrong value.
         Either missing a row or duplicating a row.

         We solve this problem, by using an array exclusively to use in
         replciation pfs tables, by marking a master_info defeated as 0
         (i.e NULL). A new master info is added to this array at the
         first NULL always.
