  SYNOPSIS
    prepare_tz_info()
      sp - pointer to time zone description
      storage - pointer to MEM_ROOT where arrays for map allocated

  DESCRIPTION
    First task of this function is to find fallback time type which will
    be used if there are no transitions or we have moment in time before
    any transitions.
    Second task is to build "shifted my_time_t" -> my_time_t map used in
    MYSQL_TIME -> my_time_t conversion.
    Note: See description of TIME_to_gmt_sec() function first.
    In order to perform MYSQL_TIME -> my_time_t conversion we need to build
  table which defines "shifted by tz offset and leap seconds my_time_t" ->
    my_time_t function which is almost the same (except ranges of ambiguity)
    as reverse function to piecewise linear function used for my_time_t ->
    "shifted my_time_t" conversion and which is also specified as table in
    zoneinfo file or in our db (It is specified as start of time type ranges
    and time type offsets). So basic idea is very simple - let us iterate
    through my_time_t space from one point of discontinuity of my_time_t ->
    "shifted my_time_t" function to another and build our approximation of
    reverse function. (Actually we iterate through ranges on which
    my_time_t -> "shifted my_time_t" is linear function).

  RETURN VALUES
    0	Ok
    1	Error
