  record at a time until Read() returns EOF. A RowIterator can read from
  other Iterators if you want to, e.g., SortingIterator, which takes in records
  from another RowIterator and sorts them.

  The abstraction is not completely tight. In particular, it still leaves some
  specifics to TABLE, such as which columns to read (the read_set). This means
  it would probably be hard as-is to e.g. sort a join of two tables.

    Start performance schema batch mode, if supported (otherwise ignored).

    PFS batch mode is a mitigation to reduce the overhead of performance schema,
    typically applied at the innermost table of the entire join. If you start
    it before scanning the table and then end it afterwards, the entire set
    of handler calls will be timed only once, as a group, and the costs will
    be distributed evenly out. This reduces timer overhead.

    If you start PFS batch mode, you must also take care to end it at the
    end of the scan, one way or the other. Do note that this is true even
    if the query ends abruptly (LIMIT is reached, or an error happens).
    The easiest workaround for this is to simply call EndPSIBatchModeIfStarted()
    on the root iterator at the end of the scan. See the PFSBatchMode class for
    a useful helper.

    The rules for starting batch and ending mode are:

      1. If you are an iterator with exactly one child (FilterIterator etc.),
         forward any StartPSIBatchMode() calls to it.
      2. If you drive an iterator (read rows from it using a for loop
         or similar), use PFSBatchMode as described above.
      3. If you have multiple children, ignore the call and do your own
         handling of batch mode as appropriate. For materialization,
         #2 would typically apply. For joins, it depends on the join type
         (e.g., NestedLoopIterator applies batch mode only when scanning
         the innermost table).

    The upshot of this is that when scanning a single table, batch mode
    will typically be activated for that table (since we call
    StartPSIBatchMode() on the root iterator, and it will trickle all the way
    down to the table iterator), but for a join, the call will be ignored
    and the join iterator will activate batch mode by itself as needed.

    EndPSIBatchModeIfStarted() call to every iterator they could conceivably
    have called StartPSIBatchMode() on. This ensures that after such a call
    to on the root iterator, all handlers are out of batch mode.
