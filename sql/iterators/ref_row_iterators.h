   This is the counterpart of RefIterator / EQRefIterator for child
   tables in a pushed join. As the underlying handler interface for
   pushed joins are the same for Ref / EQRef operations, we implement
   both in the same PushedJoinRefIterator class.

   In order to differentiate between a 'range' and 'single-row lookup'
   in the DebugString(), the class takes a 'bool Unique' C'tor argument.
   This also offers some optimizations in implementation of ::Read().

   When the table access is performed as part of the pushed join,
   all 'linked' child columns are prefetched together with the parent row.
   The handler will then only format the row as required by MySQL and set
   table status accordingly.

   However, there may be situations where the prepared pushed join was not
   executed as assumed. It is the responsibility of the handler to handle
   these situation by letting @c ha_index_read_pushed() then effectively do a
   plain old' index_read_map(..., HA_READ_KEY_EXACT);
