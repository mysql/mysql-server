///
/// This file contains the HashJoinRowBuffer class and related
/// functions/classes.
///
/// A HashJoinBuffer is a row buffer that can hold a certain amount of rows.
/// The rows are stored in a hash table, which allows for constant-time lookup.
/// The HashJoinBuffer maintains its own internal MEM_ROOT, where all of the
/// data is allocated.
///
/// The HashJoinBuffer contains an operand with rows from one or more tables,
/// keyed on the value we join on. Consider the following trivial example:
///
///   SELECT t1.data FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON (t1.key = t2.key);
///
/// Let us say that the table "t2" is stored in a HashJoinBuffer. In this case,
/// the hash table key will be the value found in "t2.key", since that is the
/// join condition that belongs to t2. If we have multiple equalities, they
/// will be concatenated together in order to form the hash table key. The hash
/// table key is a std::string_view.
///
/// In order to store a row, we use the function StoreFromTableBuffers. See the
/// comments attached to the function for more details.
///
/// The amount of memory a HashJoinBuffer instance can use is limited by the
/// system variable "join_buffer_size". However, note that we check whether we
/// have exceeded the memory limit _after_ we have inserted data into the row
/// buffer. As such, we will probably use a little bit more memory than
/// specified by join_buffer_size.
///
/// The primary use case for these classes is, as the name implies,
/// for implementing hash join.

/// The key type for the hash structure in HashJoinRowBuffer.
///
/// A key consists of the value from one or more columns, taken from the join
/// condition(s) in the query.  E.g., if the join condition is
/// (t1.col1 = t2.col1 AND t1.col2 = t2.col2), the key is (col1, col2), with the
/// two key parts concatenated together.
///
/// What the data actually contains depends on the comparison context for the
/// join condition. For instance, if the join condition is between a string
/// column and an integer column, the comparison will be done in a string
/// context, and thus the integers will be converted to strings before storing.
/// So the data we store in the key are in some cases converted, so that we can
/// hash and compare them byte-by-byte (i.e. decimals), while other types are
/// already comparable byte-by-byte (i.e. integers), and thus stored as-is.
///
/// Note that the key data can come from items as well as fields if the join
/// condition is an expression. E.g. if the join condition is
/// UPPER(t1.col1) = UPPER(t2.col1), the join key data will come from an Item
/// instead of a Field.
///
/// The Key class never takes ownership of the data. As such, the user must
/// ensure that the data has the proper lifetime. When storing rows in the row
/// buffer, the data must have the same lifetime as the row buffer itself.
/// When using the Key class for lookups in the row buffer, the same lifetime is
/// not needed; the key object is only needed when the lookup is done.
