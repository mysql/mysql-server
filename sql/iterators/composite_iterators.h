/**
  @file composite_iterators.h

  A composite row iterator is one that takes in one or more existing iterators
  and processes their rows in some interesting way. They are usually not bound
  to a single table or similar, but are the inner (non-leaf) nodes of the
  iterator execution tree. They consistently own their source iterator, although
  not its memory (since we never allocate row iterators on the heap--usually on
  a MEM_ROOT>). This means that in the end, you'll end up with a single root
  iterator which then owns everything else recursively.

  SortingIterator and the two window iterators are also composite iterators,
  but are defined in their own files.

  Handles aggregation (typically used for GROUP BY) for the case where the rows
  are already properly grouped coming in, ie., all rows that are supposed to be
  part of the same group are adjacent in the input stream. (This could be
  because they were sorted earlier, because we are scanning an index that
  already gives us the rows in a group-compatible order, or because there is no
  grouping.)

  AggregateIterator needs to be able to save and restore rows; it doesn't know
  when a group ends until it's seen the first row that is part of the _next_
  group. When that happens, it needs to tuck away that next row, and then
  restore the previous row so that the output row gets the correct grouped
  values. A simple example, doing SELECT a, SUM(b) FROM t1 GROUP BY a:

    t1.a  t1.b                                       SUM(b)
     1     1     <-- first row, save it                1
     1     2                                           3
     1     3                                           6
     2     1     <-- group changed, save row
    [1     1]    <-- restore first row, output         6
                     reset aggregate              -->  0
    [2     1]    <-- restore new row, process it       1
     2    10                                          11
                 <-- EOF, output                      11

  To save and restore rows like this, it uses the infrastructure from
  pack_rows.h to pack and unpack all relevant rows into record[0] of every input
  table. (Currently, there can only be one input table, but this may very well
  change in the future.) It would be nice to have a more abstract concept of
  sending a row around and taking copies of it if needed, as opposed to it
  implicitly staying in the table's buffer. (This would also solve some
  issues in EQRefIterator and when synthesizing NULL rows for outer joins.)
  However, that's a large refactoring.

  is just like an inner join as we long as we can get rid of the duplicates
  somehow. (This is advantageous, because inner joins can be reordered, whereas
  semijoins generally can't.) However, unlike semijoin materialization, weedout
  removes duplicates after the join, not before it. Consider something like

    SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a IN ( SELECT b FROM t2 );

  Semijoin materialization solves this by materializing t2, with deduplication,
  and then joining. Weedout joins t1 to t2 and then leaves only one output row
  per t1 row. The disadvantage is that this potentially needs to discard more
  rows; the (potential) advantage is that we deduplicate on t1 instead of t2.

  Weedout, unlike materialization, works in a streaming fashion; rows are output
  (or discarded) as they come in, with a temporary table used for recording the
  row IDs we've seen before. (We need to deduplicate on t1's row IDs, not its
  contents.) See SJ_TMP_TABLE for details about the table format.

/**
  An iterator that is semantically equivalent to a semijoin NestedLoopIterator
  immediately followed by a RemoveDuplicatesOnIndexIterator. It is used to
  implement the “loose scan” strategy in queries with multiple tables on the
  inside of a semijoin, like

    ... FROM t1 WHERE ... IN ( SELECT ... FROM t2 JOIN t3 ... )

  In this case, the query tree without this iterator would ostensibly look like

    -> Nested loop join
       -> Table scan on t1
       -> Remove duplicates on t2_idx
          -> Nested loop semijoin
             -> Index scan on t2 using t2_idx
             -> Filter (e.g. t3.a = t2.a)
                -> Table scan on t3

  (t3 will be marked as “first match” on t2 when implementing loose scan,
  thus the semijoin.)

  First note that we can't put the duplicate removal directly on t2 in this
  case, as the first t2 row doesn't necessarily match anything in t3, so it
  needs to be above. However, this is wasteful, because once we find a matching
  t2/t3 pair, we should stop scanning t3 until we have a new t2.

  NestedLoopSemiJoinWithDuplicateRemovalIterator solves the problem by doing
  exactly this; it gets a row from the outer side, gets exactly one row from the
  inner side, and then skips over rows from the outer side (_without_ scanning
  the inner side) until its keypart changes.
