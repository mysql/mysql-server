/**
  Thread class responsible for the collection of write sets associated
  to a transaction.

  It also includes support for save points where information will be discarded
  on rollbacks to a savepoint.

  Write set and flags are reset on
    Rpl_transaction_write_set_ctx::reset_state().

  The write set collection by an executing transaction is capped to a limit.
  The limit can be "soft" or "hard":
  - when a writeset grows above a "soft" limit, the transaction is allowed to
  execute and commit, but the write set is discarded, and the transaction
  declared to not have a usable write set.
  - when a write set grows above a "hard" limit, the transaction is forced
  to abort and rollback.

  We cannot use a soft limit for transactions that will be certified in GR,
  since a writeset is required for correct certification. But when GR is
  disabled, we can use a soft limit, because the writeset is only used to
  compute transaction dependencies, and we can pessimistically mark the
  transaction as conflicting with all other transcations when the writeset
  is discarded.
  A soft limit can also be used for transactions executed by the GR recovery
  channel, since they will not be certified, and the GR applier channel,
  since those transactions have already passed the certification stage.

  For the soft limit, we use
    - binlog_transaction_dependency_history_size.
  Transactions bigger than that cannot be added to the writeset history
  since they do not fit, and therefore are marked as conflicting with all
  *subsequent* transactions anyways.
  Therefore much of the parallelization for the transaction is already
  destroyed, and it is unlikely that also marking it as conflicting with
  *previous* transactions makes a significant difference.

  For the hard limit, when using Group Replication, we use
    - group_replication_transaction_size_limit.
  Since the writeset is a subset of the transaction, and the transaction
  is limited to this size anyways, a transaction whose writeset exceeds
  this limit will fail anyways.
  So failing it when generating the writeset is merely a fail-fast mechanism,
  and it is not a restriction to apply this limit to the writeset of all
  transactions for which the full transaction data is also subject to the limit.
  The transactions that are subject to this limit are exactly those executed
  when GR is enabled, except by the GR applier channel and GR recovery channel.

  We expose the following interfaces so that components such as GR
  can control the limit.
  There is an interface to *globally*
   disable/enable the soft limit:
     static void set_global_require_full_write_set(bool requires_ws);
   set/alter/remove a hard limit:
     static void set_global_write_set_memory_size_limit(uint64 limit)
     static void update_global_write_set_memory_size_limit(uint64 limit);

  There is another interface to override the global limits for a thread:
    void set_local_ignore_write_set_memory_limit(bool ignore_limit);
    void set_local_allow_drop_write_set(bool allow_drop_write_set);

  The local methods are used for example for Group Replication applier and
  recovery threads as group_replication_transaction_size_limit only applies
  to client sessions and non group replication replica threads.
