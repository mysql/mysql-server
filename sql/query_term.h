/**
  This class hierarchy is used to represent SQL structures between \<query
  expression\> and \<query specification\>. The class Query_expression
  represents \<query expression\> and the class Query_block represents \<query
  specification\>, \<table value constructor\> and \<explicit table\>,
  cf. definitions in sql_lex.h. Originally, MySQL supported only one set
  operation, UNION. This was implicitly represented by having one
  Query_expression object own several Query_block objects via next pointers.
  This made things simple, but limited us to left-deep nesting of unions, and
  also from representing INTERSECTION and EXCEPT, as well as nesting several
  layers of \<query primary\>s containing \<query expression body\>s, e.g.

     (((SELECT a,b FROM t) ORDER BY a LIMIT 5) ORDER BY -b LIMIT 3) ORDER BY a;

  could not be supported. With the present class hierarchy we enable the full
  set of set operations and arbitrary nesting, as allowed by the SQL grammar,
  viz:
  \verbatim
  <query expression> ::=
      [ <with clause> ] <query expression body>
      [ <order by clause> ] [ <limit/offset> ]

  <query expression body> ::=
     <query term>
   | <query expression body> UNION [ ALL | DISTINCT ]
     [ <corresponding spec> ] <query term>
   | <query expression body> EXCEPT [ ALL | DISTINCT ]
     [ <corresponding spec> ] <query term>

  <query term> ::=
     <query primary>
   | <query expression body> INTERSECT [ ALL | DISTINCT ]
     [ <corresponding spec> ] <query primary>

  <query primary> ::=
     <simple table>
   | <left paren> <query expression body>
     [ <order by clause> ] [ <limit/offset (*)> ]
     <right paren>

  <simple table> ::=
     <query specification>
   | <table value constructor>
   | <explicit table>

  (*) MySQL syntax and semantics. The standard uses /<result offset clause/> and
      \<fetch first clause\>.

  \endverbatim
  Note that INTERSECT binds tighter than UNION and EXCEPT.
  Now, let's turn to how these structures are represented in MySQL.
  The node types are enumerated by Query_term_type. The nodes themselves
  by the class hierarchy rooted in Query_term (abstract).
*/

/// Node type of the query term tree nodes
enum Query_term_type {
  /// Represents Query specification, table value constructor and
  /// explicit table
  QT_QUERY_BLOCK,
  /// Represents a query primary with parentesized query expression body with
  /// order by clause and/or limit/offset clause. If none of order by
  /// or limit is present, we collapse this level of parentheses.
  QT_UNARY,
  /// Represents the three set operations. Nodes are N-ary, i.e. a node can hold
  /// two or more operands.
  QT_INTERSECT,
  QT_EXCEPT,
  QT_UNION
};

/// Query term iterator template argument type: how to visit nodes in tree
enum Visit_order { QTC_POST_ORDER, QTC_PRE_ORDER };
/// Query term iterator template argument type: whether to visit leaf nodes
enum Visit_leaves { VL_VISIT_LEAVES, VL_SKIP_LEAVES };

/**
  Query term tree structure. There are five node types, cf. Query_term_type.
  Leaf nodes are Query_block objects. We have three kinds of n-ary set operation
  nodes corresponding to INTERSECT, UNION and EXCEPT. Finally, we have a "unary"
  node which essentially adds a ORDER BY/LIMIT over another node.

  Query blocks serve a dual purpose: they represent the query specification and
  table constructors of the query. As such they are the leaf nodes of the query
  tree.  But they also serve as a way to realize ORDER BY and LIMIT for non-leaf
  nodes, accessed via the function Query_term::query_block().  Therefore, every
  non-leaf node in the tree has a companion Query_block to hold ORDER BY and
  LIMIT information.  For the leaf nodes, which are themselves query blocks, the
  query_block() function just returns a pointer to self, i.e. the leaf nodes
  handle ORDER BY and LIMIT themselves.

  \verbatim
  Example: ((SELECT * FROM t1 UNION SELECT * FROM t2 UNION ALL SELECT * FROM t3
             ORDER BY a LIMIT 5) INTERSECT
            (((SELECT * FROM t3 ORDER BY a LIMIT 4) ) EXCEPT SELECT * FROM t4)
            ORDER BY a LIMIT 4) ORDER BY -a LIMIT 3;

  Note that all leaf query blocks representing the query specifications are
  linked under Query_expression via their next pointers. The nesting is achieved
  by the arrows on the left side of the figure, via the nodes' m_children
  members. The four classes Query_term_unary and Query_term_{union, intersect,
  except} are modelled via the base class Query_term_set_op which contains a
  m_children member. Each of these also contain a Query_block which will handle
  its order by and/or limit clauses. These are similar to the old so-called
  "fake_query_block" (which is now gone), and are not linked in with "next"
  pointers.

  The is also a back pointer from the children nodes to the parent Query_term
  object (not shown).

  In the simple case of a single query specification (or table value constructor
  or explicit table), there is no super-structure over the Query_block linked
  from the Query_expression, i.e. Query_expression's m_query_term member is just
  a Query_block.

  The query blocks (QT_QUERY_BLOCK nodes) corresponding to the query
  specification (or table value constructors) are prepared and optimized by
  running over them from the Query_expression via the slave/next pointers as
  before. There are separate methods which handle prepare and optimization for
  non-leaves, i.e. nodes of types QT_UNARY, QT_INTERSECT, QT_EXCEPT and
  QT_UNION.

  We also define an iterator class (Query_terms) for iterating over all
  the nodes in the tree, see also Query_expression::query_terms() for its use.
  When possible, we access all nodes using iterators.

  The built structure can be traced with the debug trace keyword "ast", e.g.
  as SET SESSION debug = 'd,ast:O,/tmp/mysqld.trace';
