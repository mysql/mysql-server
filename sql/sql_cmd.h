/**
  Representation of an SQL command.

  This class is an interface between the parser and the runtime.
  The parser builds the appropriate derived classes of Sql_cmd
  to represent a SQL statement in the parsed tree.
  The execute() method in the derived classes of Sql_cmd contain the runtime
  implementation.
  Note that this interface is used for SQL statements recently implemented,
  the code for older statements tend to load the LEX structure with more
  attributes instead.
  Implement new statements by sub-classing Sql_cmd, as this improves
  code modularity (see the 'big switch' in dispatch_command()), and decreases
  the total size of the LEX structure (therefore saving memory in stored
  programs).
  The recommended name of a derived class of Sql_cmd is Sql_cmd_<derived>.

  Notice that the Sql_cmd class should not be confused with the Statement class.
  Statement is a class that is used to manage an SQL command or a set
  of SQL commands. When the SQL statement text is analyzed, the parser will
  create one or more Sql_cmd objects to represent the actual SQL commands.
