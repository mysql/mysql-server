/**
  @file log_sink_perfschema.cc

  This file contains

  a) the ring-buffer that stores a backlog of error-messages so
  they can be exposed to the SQL layer via performance_schema.error_log;

  b) the log-sink that adds errors logged at run-time to the ring-buffer.

  c) the error log reader that reads error log file at start-up
  (These functions will in turn use a parse-function defined
  in a log-sink. Whichever log-sink that has a parse-function
  is listed first in @@global.log_error_services will be used;
  that service will decide what log-file to read (i.e. its name)
  and how to parse it. We initially support the reading of JSON-
  formatted error log files and of the traditional MySQL error
  log files.)
  This lets us restore error log information from previous runs
  when the server starts.
  These functions are called from mysqld.cc at start-up.

  In the interest of not adding more settings to confuse the using,

  While a log-event can currently be up to 8 KB in size (and with
  minor changes be of practically arbitrary size), a majority of
  common events seem to be in the 150 - 200 bytes range (in trad
  mode, perhaps 100 more each in JSON mode) at the time of this
  writing.  That lead us to expect a yield of 4-6 events per KB,

/**
  Add all rows from a log file to the error-log ring-buffer.

  We have to guesstimate where to start reading in the log:

  - The error_log table is kept in a ring-buffer.
    Reading more items than we have space for is therefore harmless;
    we should however try to keep the waste down for performance
    reasons.

  - In the traditional log, the part of the row before the message
    is 63 characters long.  This gets converted into an event header.
    The header's size is platform-dependent, but usually shorter
    than 63 bytes. Thus, the size of each record in the input will
    be more or less the size of its corresponding record in the
    output. As a consequence, reading the ring-buffer's size from
    the input should be about right.

  - When reading the JSON log, we'll fill in the event header from
    the parsed values, but we will also attach the entire JSON record
    to the event. Each record in the ring-buffer is therefore the
    size of the original JSON record, plus the size of a record header.
    As a consequence reading the ring-buffer's size from the input
    will give us more events than we need (because we "lose" about
    50 bytes to the header for each event). However, the input is of
    variable length and we can not tell whether it's a few long rows
    or a lot of short ones. Therefore, we assume the worst (rather
    than the average) case and try to read input the size of the
    ring-buffer. This will mean that we read some more rows than we
    have space for, but since it's a ring-buffer, that means that
    the oldest entries will be discarded to make room for the younger
    ones, and we'll end up with the correct result.

// The public interface to restoring the error-log to the ring-buffer:

/**
  Restore error log messages from previous shutdown.

  We try restoring from the first (leftmost) of those services
  listed in @@global.log_error_services that have the
  LOG_SERVICE_LOG_PARSER characteristic.

  It is assumed that the last run's log file name is the same
  as the current one's. That is to say, we check whether the
  file supplied to --log-error already exists.

  Once we have determined what file to read from, we'll call
  @see log_error_read_loop() to do the actual reading and parsing.

  It should be noted that at the point this function is normally
  called, buffered error logging will not have flushed yet.

  a) If we are using the built-in "trad" sink/reader, the start-up
  messages are usually not buffered, and have already been written
  to the error log. In this case, they will be restored from the
  log (and flushing won't add another event to the ring-buffer).

  b) If we are using a reader in a loadable log-service,

  @param  log_name  The log file to read (log_error_dest).
