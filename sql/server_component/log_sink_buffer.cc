  @file log_sink_buffer.cc

  a) the log-sink that buffers errors logged during start-up so they
  can be flushed once all configured log-components have become available;

  b) the functions for querying and setting the phase the server is in
  with regard to logging (buffering, normal operation, and so forth);

  c) the functions for flushing the buffered information (to force writing
  out this information in cases of early shutdowns and so on).

/**
  Make sure only one instance of the buffered "writer" runs at a time.

  In normal operation, the log-event will be created dynamically, then
  it will be fed through the pipeline, and then it will be released.
  Since the event is allocated in the caller, we can be sure it won't
  go away wholesale during processing, and since the event is local to
  the caller, no other thread will tangle with it. It is therefore safe
  in those cases not to wrap a lock around the event.
  (The log-pipeline will still grab a shared lock, THR_LOCK_log_stack,
  to protect the pipeline (not the event) and the log-services cache from
  being changed while the pipeline is being applied.
  Likewise, log-services may protect their resources (file-writers will
  usually take a lock to serialize their writes; the built-in filter will
  take a lock on its rule-set as that is shared between concurrent
  threads running the filter, and so on).
  None of these are intended to protect the event itself though.

  In buffered mode on the other hand, we copy each log-event (the
  original of which, see above, is owned by the caller and local
  to the thread, and therefore safe without locking) to a global
  buffer / backlog. As this backlog can be added to by all threads,
  it must be protected by a lock (once we have fully initialized
  the subsystem with log_builtins_init() and support multi-threaded
  mode anyway, as indicated by log_builtins_started being non-zero,
  see below). This is that lock.

  services: log sinks: buffered logging

  During start-up, we buffer log-info until a) we have basic info for
  the built-in logger (what file to log to, verbosity, and so on), and
  b) advanced info (any logging components to load, any configuration
  for them, etc.).

  As a failsafe, if start-up takes very, very long, and a time-out is
  reached before reaching b) and we actually have something worth
  reporting (e.g. errors, as opposed to info), we try to keep the user
  informed by using the basic logger configured in a), while going on
  buffering all info and flushing it to any advanced loggers when b)
  is reached.

  1) This function checks and, if needed, updates the time-out, and calls
     the flush functions as needed. It is internal to the logger and should
     not be called from elsewhere.

  2) Function will save log-event (if given) for later filtering and output.

  3) Function acquires/releases THR_LOCK_log_buffered if initialized.

                                        logger's locks are initialized, so
