/**
 * The Join_nest class, and its subclasses, provides a hierarchical tree-like
 * representation of the query and its join operations. It is constructed
 * as a result of traversing the AccessPath structure, and collect
 * query plan information in a structure more suitable for the AQP
 * interface.
 *
 * The Join_nest are related to a collection of tables being
 * members of the nest(s). There is also a JoinType (INNER, OUTER, SEMI, ANTI)
 * assigned to each nest which describes how tables in the nest is joined
 * relative to tables in the upper nest(s). Join_nests are contained within
 * each other, which is represented with an 'upper_nest' reference, which is
 * the nest we are contained within (An inverse tree, referring the parents, not
 * the children)
 *
 * JoinType::INNER is the default join type for a join nest. Note that there
 * will often be multiple such INNER-Join_nests nested inside each other.
 * Wrt join semantics, such nested INNER joins are redundant, and are thus
 * ignored when we need to find the real boundary of the INNER join nest.
 * (See get_inner_nest(), get_first_inner(), get_last_inner()). However, these
 * extra INNER-Join_nest are useful when representing the general structure
 * of the AccessPath, and the scope of condition filters attached to a subset
 * of the tables.
 *
 * The Join_nest class provide methods for finding the [first..last] range
 * of tables being members of the same set of INNER-joined tables. Such
 * functionality is also provided for a set of SEMI-joined tables.
 *
 * The Join_nest structure itself impose no restrictions on how tables
 * and rows from within the nests are referred. The query executor will iterate
 * the tables being members of the 'nests' in a left deep streaming pattern,
 * using a nested-loop like algorithm, without any temporary buffering or reorg
 * of the intermediate result sets in between. (This property is important for
 * NDB pushed join, as it basically supports only a set of nested-loop-joined
 * tables.)
 *
 * Furthermore, tables being members of different Join_nest branches, where
 * both branches has a common upper join_nest, are said to be in the same
 * join scope. See further detail of how a 'scope' is represented by a subclass
 * of the 'nest' below.

/**
 * A Join_scope(above) is always contained within a Query_scope.
 * (which in turn might be contained in another Query_scope...)
 *
 * The Query_scope further restrict how a Join_scope may refer
 * tables in upper-scopes. This is related to the implementation
 * of the two AQP methods:
 *
 * - get_tables_in_this_query_scope() -> Tables limited to this Query_scope
 * - get_tables_in_all_query_scopes() -> Include tables in upper scopes as well
 *
 * A Query_scope is typically created when there are some requirements of
 * the entire AccessPath branch to be fully evaluated before we return to
 * upper levels. This is typically for e.g.:
 *
 *  - An agreggate sub-path, where all rows matching some outer references
 *    must be collected before finding a min/max
 *  - A materialized sub query, where all rows fulfilling the outer/upper
 *    reference must be collected for the subquery to be complete.
 *
 * Note that the above 'fully evaluated' is not guaranteed if not enforced
 * with a Query_scope. (might come as a surprise). Due to the batching fetch
 * of rows from NDB, result generation may 'give up' in specific AccessPath
 * branch when all batched rows has been consumed there. It then returns
 * to upper levels to see what can be generated there. Finally when the all
 * batches rows are consumed, the entire pipeline is refilled, and we take
 * anothed dive into the branches. Thus result rows might be generated out of
 * sequence, in multiple rounds, relative to upper rows. This is within specs
 * for join operations as a join implies now ordering of the individual rows.
 *
 * However, some of the Iterators which implements the AccessPath operations
 * has such requirements. Thus a Query_scope must be inserted wherever required
 * by them.
 *
 * Wrt. NDB pushed joins it will be restricted to be entirely within
 * the Query_scope. However, (pushed-)conditions and keys used in the
 * pushed joins may still refer to table values from all upper-scopes,
 * even if the table itself can't be a member of the same pushed join.
 *
 * Note that in its most common form, the Join_nest structure will
 * consist of single Query_scope, (which 'is a' Join_scope as well,)
 * containing a set of Join_nests.
 *
 * The simplest form will be just a Query_scope, (which 'is a' Join_scope,
 * as well as a Join_nest), containing a single table.
 * (There is always a topmost Query_scope)
 *
 * Having multiple nested Query_scopes is more the exception, where there
 * is Aggregates, or materialize queries
