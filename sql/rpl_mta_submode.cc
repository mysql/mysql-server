   Staleness is caused by GAQ garbage collection that increments the rhs of (*),

   The method implements logical timestamp conflict detection

   The conflict or waiting condition is like the following

           lwm < last_committed,

   where lwm is a minimum logical timestamp of committed transactions.
   Since the lwm's exact value is not always available its pessimistic
   estimate (an old version) is improved (get_lwm_timestamp()) as the
   first step before to the actual waiting commitment.

   Special cases include:

   When @c last_committed_arg is uninitialized the calling thread must
   proceed without waiting for anyone. Any possible dependency with unknown
   commit parent transaction shall be sorted out by the parent;

   When the gaq index is subsequent to the last lwm index
   there's no dependency of the current transaction with any regardless of
   lwm timestamp should it be SEQ_UNINIT.
   Consequently when GAQ consists of just one item there's none to wait.
   Such latter case is left to the caller to handle.

   @note The caller must make sure the current transaction won't be waiting
         for itself. That is the method should not be caller by a Worker
         whose group assignment is in the GAQ front item.
