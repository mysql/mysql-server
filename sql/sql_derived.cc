/**
  Merge a derived table/view into the embedding select

  @param thd     thread handle
  @param lex     LEX of the embedding query.
  @param derived reference to the derived table.

  @details
  This function merges the given derived table / view into the parent select
  construction. Any derived table/reference to view occurred in the FROM
  clause of the embedding select is represented by a TABLE_LIST structure a
  pointer to which is passed to the function as in the parameter 'derived'.
  This structure contains  the number/map, alias, a link to SELECT_LEX of the
  derived table and other info. If the 'derived' table is used in a nested join
  then additionally the structure contains a reference to the ON expression
  for this join.

  The merge process results in elimination of the derived table (or the
  reference to a view) such that:
    - the FROM list of the derived table/view is wrapped into a nested join
      after which the nest is added to the FROM list of the embedding select
    - the WHERE condition of the derived table (view) is ANDed with the ON
      condition attached to the table.

  @note
  Tables are merged into the leaf_tables list, original derived table is removed
  from this list also. SELECT_LEX::table_list list is left untouched.
  Where expression is merged with derived table's on_expr and can be found after
  the merge through the SELECT_LEX::table_list.

  Examples of the derived table/view merge:

  Schema:
  Tables: t1(f1), t2(f2), t3(f3)
  View v1: SELECT f1 FROM t1 WHERE f1 < 1

  Example with a view:
    Before merge:

    The query (Q1): SELECT f1,f2 FROM t2 LEFT JOIN v1 ON f1 = f2

       (LEX of the main query)
                 |
           (select_lex)
                 |
         (FROM table list)
                 |
            (join list)= t2, v1
                             / \
                            /  (on_expr)= (f1 = f2)
                            |
                    (LEX of the v1 view)
                            |
                       (select_lex)= SELECT f1 FROM t1 WHERE f1 < 1


    After merge:

    The rewritten query Q1 (Q1'):
      SELECT f1,f2 FROM t2 LEFT JOIN (t1) ON ((f1 = f2) and (f1 < 1))

        (LEX of the main query)
                   |
             (select_lex)
                   |
           (FROM table list)
                   |
               (join list)= t2, (t1)
                                    \
                                   (on_expr)= (f1 = f2) and (f1 < 1)

    In this example table numbers are assigned as follows:
      (outer select): t2 - 1, v1 - 2
      (inner select): t1 - 1
    After the merge table numbers will be:
      (outer select): t2 - 1, t1 - 2

  Example with a derived table:
    The query Q2:
      SELECT f1,f2
       FROM (SELECT f1 FROM t1, t3 WHERE f1=f3 and f1 < 1) tt, t2
       WHERE f1 = f2

    Before merge:
              (LEX of the main query)
                        |
                  (select_lex)
                  /           \
       (FROM table list)   (WHERE clause)= (f1 = f2)
                  |
           (join list)= tt, t2
                       / \
                      /  (on_expr)= (empty)
                     /
           (select_lex)= SELECT f1 FROM t1, t3 WHERE f1 = f3 and f1 < 1

    After merge:

    The rewritten query Q2 (Q2'):
      SELECT f1,f2
       FROM (t1, t3) JOIN t2 ON (f1 = f3 and f1 < 1)
       WHERE f1 = f2

              (LEX of the main query)
                        |
                  (select_lex)
                  /           \
       (FROM table list)   (WHERE clause)= (f1 = f2)
                 |
          (join list)= t2, (t1, t3)
                                   \
                                 (on_expr)= (f1 = f3 and f1 < 1)

  In this example table numbers are assigned as follows:
    (outer select): tt - 1, t2 - 2
    (inner select): t1 - 1, t3 - 2
  After the merge table numbers will be:
    (outer select): t1 - 1, t2 - 2, t3 - 3

  @return FALSE if derived table/view were successfully merged.
  @return TRUE if an error occur.

  @detail
  Prepare underlying select for a derived table/view. To properly resolve
  names in the embedding query the TABLE structure is created. Actual table
  is created later by the mysql_derived_create function.

  This function is called before any command containing derived table
  is executed. All types of derived tables are handled by this function:
  - Anonymous derived tables, or
  - Named derived tables (aka views).

  The table reference, contained in @c derived, is updated with the
  fields of a new temporary table.
  Derived tables are stored in @c thd->derived_tables and closed by
  close_thread_tables().

  This function is part of the procedure that starts in
  open_and_lock_tables(), a procedure that - among other things - introduces
  new table and table reference objects (to represent derived tables) that
  don't exist in the privilege database. This means that normal privilege
  checking cannot handle them. Hence this function does some extra tricks in
  order to bypass normal privilege checking, by exploiting the fact that the
  current state of privilege verification is attached as GRANT_INFO structures
  on the relevant TABLE and TABLE_REF objects.

  For table references, the current state of accrued access is stored inside
  TABLE_LIST::grant. Hence this function must update the state of fulfilled
  privileges for the new TABLE_LIST, an operation which is normally performed
  exclusively by the table and database access checking functions,
  check_access() and check_grant(), respectively. This modification is done
  for both views and anonymous derived tables: The @c SELECT privilege is set
  as fulfilled by the user. However, if a view is referenced and the table
  reference is queried against directly (see TABLE_LIST::referencing_view),
  the state of privilege checking (GRANT_INFO struct) is copied as-is to the
  temporary table.

  Only the TABLE structure is created here, actual table is created by the
  mysql_derived_create function.

  @note This function sets @c SELECT_ACL for @c TEMPTABLE views as well as
  anonymous derived tables, but this is ok since later access checking will
  distinguish between them.
