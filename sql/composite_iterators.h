/**
  @file composite_iterators.h

  A composite row iterator is one that takes in one or more existing iterators
  and processes their rows in some interesting way. They are usually not bound
  to a single table or similar, but are the inner (non-leaf) nodes of the
  iterator execution tree. They consistently own their source iterator, although
  not its memory (since we never allocate row iterators on the heap--usually on
  a MEM_ROOT or as static parts of READ_RECORD). This means that in the end,
  you'll end up with a single root iterator which then owns everything else
  recursively.

  SortingIterator is also a composite iterator, but is defined in its own file.

/**
  Handles aggregation (typically used for GROUP BY) for the case where the rows
  are already properly grouped coming in, ie., all rows that are supposed to be
  part of the same group are adjacent in the input stream. (This could be
  because they were sorted earlier, because we are scanning an index that
  already gives us the rows in a group-compatible order, or because there is no
  grouping.)

  AggregateIterator is special in that it's one of the very few row iterators
  that actually change the shape of the rows; some columns are dropped as part
  of aggregation, others (the aggregates) are added. For this reason (and also
  because we need to make copies of the group expressions -- see Read()), it
  conceptually always outputs to a temporary table. If we _are_ outputting to a
  temporary table, that's not a problem --Â we take over responsibility for
  copying the group expressions from MaterializeIterator, which would otherwise
  do it.

  However, if we are outputting directly to the user, we need somewhere to store
  the output. This is solved by abusing the slice system; since we only need to
  buffer a single row, we can set up just enough items in the
  REF_SLICE_ORDERED_GROUP_BY slice, so that it can hold a single row. This row
  is then used for our output, and we then switch to it just before the end of
  Read() so that anyone reading from the buffers will get that output.
  The caller knows the context about where our output goes, and thus also picks
  the appropriate output slice for us.

  This isn't very pretty. What should be done is probably a more abstract
  concept of sending a row around and taking copies of it if needed, as opposed
  to it implicitly staying in the table's buffer. (This would also solve some
  issues in EQRefIterator and when synthesizing NULL rows for outer joins.)
  However, that's a large refactoring.
