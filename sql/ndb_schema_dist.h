/**
  @brief Ndb_schema_dist_client, class represents a Client
  in the schema distribution.

  Contains functionality for distributing a schema operation
  to the other MySQL Server(s) which need to update their
  data structures when a metadata change occurs.

  The Client primarily communicates with the Coordinator(which is
  in the same MySQL Server) while the Coordinator handles communication
  with the Participant nodes(in other MySQL Serve)r. When Coordinator
  have got replies from all Participants, by acknowledging the schema
  operation, the Client will be woken up again.

  Should also have functionality for:
   - checking that "schema dist is ready", i.e checking that
     the mysql.ndb_schema table has been created and schema
     distribution has been initialized properly(by the ndb
     binlog thread)
   - checking that schema distribution of the table and db name
     is suported by the current mysql.ndb_schema, for example
     that length of the table or db name fits in the columns of that
     table
   - checking which functionality the other MySQL Server(s) support,
     for example if they are on an older version they would probably
     still not support longer table names or new schema dist operation types.
