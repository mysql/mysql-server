/// @file
///
/// An iterator for joining two inputs by using hashing to match rows from
/// the inputs.
///
/// The iterator starts out by doing everything in-memory. If everything fits
/// into memory, the joining algorithm works like this:
///
/// 1) Designate one input as the "build" input and one input as the "probe"
/// input. Ideally, the smallest input measured in total size (not number of
/// rows) should be designated as the build input.
///
/// 2) Read all the rows from the build input into an in-memory hash table.
/// The hash key used in the hash table is calculated from the join attributes,
/// e.g., if we have the following query where "orders" is designated as the
/// build input:
///
///   SELECT * FROM lineitem
///     INNER JOIN orders ON orders.o_orderkey = lineitem.l_orderkey;
///
/// the hash value will be calculated from the values in the column
/// orders.o_orderkey. Note that the optimizer recognizes implicit join
/// conditions, so this also works for SQL statements like:
///
///   SELECT * FROM orders, lineitem
///     WHERE orders.o_orderkey = lineitem.l_orderkey;
///
/// 3) Then, we read the rows from the probe input, one by one. For each row,
/// a hash key is calculated for the other side of the join (the probe input)
/// using the join attribute (lineitem.l_orderkey in the above example) and the
/// same hash function as in step 2. This hash key is used to do a lookup in the
/// hash table, and for each match, an output row is produced. Note that the row
/// from the probe input is already located in the table record buffers, and the
/// matching row stored in the hash table is restored back to the record buffers
/// where it originally came from. For details around how rows are stored and
/// restored, see comments on hash_join_buffer::StoreFromTableBuffers.
///
/// The size of the in-memory hash table is controlled by the system variable
/// join_buffer_size. If we run out of memory during step 2, we degrade into a
/// hybrid hash join. The data already in memory is processed using regular hash
/// join, and the remainder is processed using on-disk hash join. It works like
/// this:
///
/// 1) The rest of the rows in the build input that did not fit into the hash
/// table are partitioned out into a given amount of files, represented by
/// HashJoinChunks. We create an equal number of chunk files for both the probe
/// and build input. We determine which file to put a row in by calculating a
/// hash from the join attribute like in step 2 above, but using a different
/// hash function.
///
/// 2) Then, we read the rows from the probe input, one by one. We look for a
/// match in the hash table as described above, but the row is also written out
/// to the chunk file on disk, since it might match a row from the build input
/// that we've written to disk.
///
/// 3) When the entire probe input is read, we run the "classic" hash join on
/// each of the corresponding chunk file probe/build pairs. Since the rows are
/// partitioned using the same hash function for probe and build inputs, we know
/// that matching rows must be located in the same pair of chunk files.
///
/// If we are able to execute the hash join in memory (classic hash join),
/// the output will be sorted the same as the left (probe) input. If we start
/// spilling to disk, we lose any reasonable ordering properties.
///
/// Note that we still might end up in a case where a single chunk file from
/// disk won't fit into memory. This is resolved by reading as much as possible
/// into the hash table, and then reading the entire probe chunk file for each
/// time the hash table is reloaded. This might happen if we have a very skewed
/// data set, for instance.
///
/// When we start spilling to disk, we allocate a maximum of "kMaxChunks"
/// chunk files on disk for each of the two inputs. The reason for having an
/// upper limit is to avoid running out of file descriptors.
///
/// There is also a flag we can set to avoid hash join spilling to disk
/// regardless of the input size. If the flag is set, the join algorithm works
/// like this:
///
/// 1) Read as many rows as possible from the build input into an in-memory hash
/// table.
/// 2) When the hash table is full (we have reached the limit set by the system
/// variable join_buffer_size), start reading from the beginning of the probe
/// input, probing for matches in the hash table. Output a row for each match
/// found.
/// 3) When the probe input is empty, see if there are any remaining rows in the
/// build input. If so, clear the in-memory hash table and go to step 1,
/// continuing from the build input where we stopped the last time. If not, the
/// join is done.
///
/// Doing everything in memory can be beneficial in a few cases. Currently, it
/// is used when we have a LIMIT without sorting or grouping in the query. The
/// gain is that we start producing output rows a lot earlier than if we were to
/// spill both inputs out to disk. It could also be beneficial if the build
/// input _almost_ fits in memory; it would likely be better to read the probe
/// input twice instead of writing both inputs out to disk. However, we do not
/// currently do any such cost based optimization.
