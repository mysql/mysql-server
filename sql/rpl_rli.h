/*******************************************************************************
Replication SQL Thread

Relay_log_info contains:
  - the current relay log
  - the current relay log offset
  - master log name
  - master log sequence corresponding to the last update
  - misc information specific to the SQL thread

Relay_log_info is initialized from a repository, i.e. table or file, if there is
one. Otherwise, data members are intialized with defaults by calling
init_relay_log_info().

The relay.info table/file shall be updated whenever: (i) the relay log file
is rotated, (ii) SQL Thread is stopped, (iii) while processing a Xid_log_event,
(iv) after a Query_log_event (i.e. commit or rollback) and (v) after processing
any statement written to the binary log without a transaction context.

The Xid_log_event is a commit for transactional engines and must be handled
differently to provide reliability/data integrity. In this case, positions
are updated within the context of the current transaction. So

  . If the relay.info is stored in a transactional repository and the server
  crashes before successfully committing the transaction the changes to the
  position table will be rolled back along with the data.

  . If the relay.info is stored in a non-transactional repository, for instance,
  a file or a system table created using MyIsam, and the server crashes before
  successfully committing the transaction the changes to the position table
  will not be rolled back but data will.

In particular, when there are mixed transactions, i.e a transaction that updates
both transaction and non-transactional engines, the Xid_log_event is still used
but reliability/data integrity cannot be achieved as we shall explain in what
follows.

Changes to non-transactional engines, such as MyIsam, cannot be rolled back if a
failure happens. For that reason, there is no point in updating the positions
within the boundaries of any on-going transaction. This is true for both commit
and rollback. If a failure happens after processing the pseudo-transaction but
before updating the positions, the transaction will be re-executed when the
slave is up most likely causing an error that needs to be manually circumvented.
This is a well-known issue when non-transactional statements are executed.

Specifically, if rolling back any transaction, positions are updated outside the
transaction boundaries. However, there may be a problem in this scenario even
when only transactional engines are updated. This happens because if there is a
rollback and such transaction is written to the binary log, a non-transactional
engine was updated or a temporary table was created or dropped within its
boundaries.

In particular, in both STATEMENT and MIXED logging formats, this happens because
any temporary table is automatically dropped after a shutdown/startup.
See BUG#26945 for further details.

Statements written to the binary log outside the boundaries of a transaction are
DDLs or maintenance commands which are not transactional. These means that they
cannot be rolled back if a failure happens. In such cases, the positions are
updated after processing the events. If a failure happens after processing the
statement but before updating the positions, the statement will be
re-executed when the slave is up most likely causing an error that needs to be
manually circumvented. This is a well-known issue when non-transactional
statements are executed.

The --sync-relay-log-info does not have effect when a system table, either
transactional or non-transactional is used.

To correctly recovery from failures, one should combine transactional system
tables along with the --relay-log-recovery.
