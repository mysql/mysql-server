/**
  Accessor methods for the weight and the number of subkeys in a buffer.

  The weight is of float type and subkeys number is of integer type. Both
  are stored in the same position of the buffer and the stored object is
  identified by the sign (bit): the weight value is positive whilst the
  number of subkeys is negative.

  In light of C's strict-aliasing rules, which roughly state that an object
  must not be accessed through incompatible types, these methods are used to
  avoid any problems arising from the type duality inside the buffer. The
  values are retrieved using a character type which can access any object.
