2000-11-27  Michael Widenius  <monty@mysql.com>

* Changed mi_create.c to use less stack.

2000-08-23  Michael Widenius  <monty@mysql.com>

* Fixed bug when comparing DECIMAL/NUMERIC key parts.

2000-08-17  Michael Widenius  <monty@mysql.com>

* Add a new flag in share.staus so that we can quickly check if a table
  is analyzed or not!

2000-07-02  Michael Widenius  <monty@mysql.com>

* Added safety margin to guard against full index file.

2000-05-22  Michael Widenius  <monty@mysql.com>

* Fixed that --join works with myisampack.

2000-05-14  Michael Widenius  <monty@mysql.com>

* Don't lock datafile during myisamchk (only indexfile is locked;  This is good
  enough for all MyISAM functions); This made it possible to close datafile
  in rep_by_sort().

2000-05-04  Michael Widenius  <monty@mysql.com>

* Fixed bug in code that scanned after rows in a crashed table.
  This could cause an infinite loop when repairing tables.
	
2000-04-26  Michael Widenius  <monty@mysql.com>

* Fixed bug when doing read_next after a delete/insert which balanced key
  pages (In this case one internal buffer was wrongly reused)

2000-04-21  Michael Widenius  <monty@tik.pp.sci.fi>

* Changed mi_find_halfpos() to return key, key_length and pos after key.
* Don't join or split key buffers in the middle when inserting a key
  that is bigger than all other keys;  This will improve inserts when
  doing these in sorted order.
	
2000-04-04  Michael Widenius  <monty@mysql.com>

* Added support for different languages on key part level.

2000-02-23  Michael Widenius  <monty@monty.pp.sci.fi>

* Fixed that myisamchk works properly with RAID.

2000-02-07  Michael Widenius  <monty@tik.pp.sci.fi>

* Added delete and rename of tables (works with RAID tables)

2000-01-29  Michael Widenius  <monty@monty.pp.sci.fi>

* Fixed the sorting of index works with prefix-packed keys.

1999-11-24  Michael Widenius  <monty@monty.pp.sci.fi>

* Fixed that DECIMAL() keys are sorted correct for negative numbers.

1999-11-22  Michael Widenius  <monty@monty.pp.sci.fi>

* removed 'NO_LOCKING' macros.
* Added function mi_rnext_same
* Added support for concurrent reads.
	
1999-11-05  Michael Widenius  <monty@tik.pp.sci.fi>

* Added function mi_scan().
* Changed all functions to return error number in case of errors.

1999-08-17  Michael Widenius  <monty@tik.pp.sci.fi>

* Added option DELAY_KEY_WRITE to tables and mi_open()

1999-08-10  Michael Widenius  <monty@tik.pp.sci.fi>

* Added support of HA_READ_PREFIX_LAST to mi_rkey().  This finds the last
  row with the given prefix.

Mon Aug  2 13:54:35 1999  Michael Widenius  <monty@bitch.pp.sci.fi>

* Added data- and key-file-length to myisamchk.
* Fixed some problems with null and space packed keys.

1999-07-15  Michael Widenius  <monty@tik.pp.sci.fi>

* The following options are for COUNT(DISTINCT ..)
* Added option HA_EXTRA_NO_ROWS;  In this case only the index tree is updated
* Added mi_delete_all_rows()
	
1999-07-13  Michael Widenius  <monty@tik.pp.sci.fi>

* Added special handling of tempoary tables

1999-06-12  Michael Widenius  <monty@monty.pp.sci.fi>

* Added optional checksum for file and for each dynamic-length row
* Added unique constraint checking
	
1999-05-06  Michael Widenius  <monty@tik.pp.sci.fi>

* All index blocks of the same size now share the same key block delete link

1999-03-17  Michael Widenius  <monty@monty.pp.sci.fi>

* Different key packing code depending on if the first key part
  is a variable length column (space packed, BLOB or VARCHAR)
* The create interface allows one to specify a key segment to start and
  end one a specific bit.  (The bit handling isn't yet implemented)
* Added more tests to 'test1'
	
1999-03-16  Michael Widenius  <monty@monty.pp.sci.fi>

* Added option -m to myisamchk as an alternative to -e (-m is faster but
  not as quite as safe as -e).
* Added option --fast to not check not changed tables.
* The first update will set a bit that the table has been changed.
* The first update to a table increments a 'open_count' field. This will
  be reset on close.  This will allow myisamchk to find tables that hasn't
  been properly closed!	
* Support for true VARCHAR columns
	
1999-03-01  Michael Widenius  <monty@monty.pp.sci.fi>

* Dynamic length blocks are double linked to allow easy reallocation
  of block lengths.  This will help that the dynamic length data will not be
  as fragmented as with ISAM.
* Extended mypack_isam to compress BLOB/TEXT columns.	
* Allow keys on BLOB.
	
1999-02-06  Michael Widenius  <monty@monty.pp.sci.fi>

* Keys, key pointers and all varibles in the index file are stored in
  high-endian-order to get better compression.
* Allow NULL on keys
	
1998-10-29  Michael Widenius  <monty@monty.pp.sci.fi>

* All data is stored in low-endian order
  (This means that the files will be architecture and OS independent)	
* All record numbers are now of type 'ha_rows' and file pointer are now of type
  my_off_t.  One can use files with 32-64 bit pointers with a 32bit or 64bit
  record handling.
  Currently the code is limited to 5 bytes pointers, but this is real easy
  to change.
