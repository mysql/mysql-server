/*
  Functions for read record cacheing with myisam
  Used for reading dynamic/compressed records from datafile.

  Can fetch data directly from file (outside cache),
  if reading a small chunk straight before the cached part (with possible
  overlap).

  Can be explicitly asked not to use cache (by not setting READING_NEXT in
  flag) - useful for occasional out-of-cache reads, when the next read is
  expected to hit the cache again.

  Allows "partial read" errors in the record header (when READING_HEADER flag
  is set) - unread part is zerofilled.

  Note: out-of-cache reads are enabled for shared IO_CACHE's too,
  as these reads will be cached by OS cache (and mysql_file_pread is always
  atomic)
