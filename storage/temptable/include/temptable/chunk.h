/** Chunk is an abstraction with the purpose of representing a smallest logical
 * memory-unit within the Block. Block allocations and deallocations are
 * served in Chunks.
 *
 * Chunk structure is:
 * - bytes [0, 7]: 8 bytes that designate the relative offset of the chunk from
 *   the start of the belonging block. This is used in order to be able to
 *   deduce the block start from a given chunk.
 * - bytes [8, chunk size): actual user data, pointer to this is returned to the
 *   user after a successful allocation request.
 *
 * As it can be seen, Chunk doesn't hold almost any information (e.g. its size)
 * but merely an offset relative to the Block address it belongs to. That's
 * what it enables Block to implement allocations and deallocations in
 * constant-time.
 *
 * Part of the Chunk contract is to have its metadata properly aligned in
 * memory. Given that this memory is provided by the Block, Chunk
 * implements debug-asserts to actually check if this condition has been met.
 * If that was not the case, then accessing unaligned memory addresses would:
 *   1. Incur performance penalty cost on architectures which can
 *      handle misaligned memory access (e.g. x86).
 *   2. Result with a CPU trap (exception) on architectures which
 *      cannot handle misaligned memory access (e.g. SPARC).
 *
 * OTOH, checking if Chunk user data is properly aligned is not possible from
 * this context because actual data-type is not known to a Chunk. This check
 * however shall be implemented in the context where the type is known (e.g.
 * Allocator)
