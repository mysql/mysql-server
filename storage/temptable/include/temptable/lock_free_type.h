/** Lock-free type selector, a helper utility which evaluates during
 * the compile-time whether the given type T has a property of being
 * always-lock-free for given platform. If true, Lock_free_type_selector::Type
 * will hold T, otherwise Lock_free_type_selector::Type will be inexisting in
 * which case static-assert will be triggered with a hopefully descriptive
 * error-message. In the event of static-assert, one can either try to select
 * another type T or, if one does not care about the actual underlying
 * type representation, simply utilize the `Largest_lock_free_type_selector`
 * utility instead. This utility will work out those details automagically. For
 * more information, see documentation on `Largest_lock_free_type_selector`.
 *
 * In short, reasoning behind this machinery lies in the fact that the standard
 * cannot guarantee that underlying implementation of std::atomic<T> is going
 * to be able to use lock-free atomic CPU instructions. That obviously depends
 * on the given type T but also on the properties of concrete platform.
 * Therefore, actual implementation is mostly platform-dependent and is
 * free to choose any other locking operation (e.g. mutex) as long as it is
 * able to fulfill the atomicity. Lock-freedom is not a pre-requisite. Only
 * exception is std::atomic_flag.
 *
 * For certain types, however, lock-freedom can be claimed upfront during the
 * compile-time phase, and this is where this utiliy kicks in. It is essentially
 * a C++14 rewrite of std::atomic<T>::is_always_lock_free which is only
 * available from C++17 onwards. Once moved to C++17 this utility will become
 * obsolete and shall be replaced with standard-compliant implementation.
 *
 * More details and motivation can be found at:
 *   http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/p0152r0.html
