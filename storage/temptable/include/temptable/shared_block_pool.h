 *
 * Each Block element in a pool is represented by a slot. Each slot can be
 * either free (default) or occupied. Acquiring the Block is possible only from
 * an empty slot. Releasing the Block makes the slot free again.
 *
 * Acquiring and releasing the Block is done via THD identifier on which,
 * implicitly, modulo-arithmethic is applied in order to pick the right slot.
 * To avoid questionable performance of modulo-arithmetic in its more general
 * form, POOL_SIZE is constrained only to numbers which are power of two. This
 * enables us to implement a modulo operation in single bitwise instruction.
 * Check whether POOL_SIZE is a number which is power of two is run during the
 * compile-time.
 *
 * Given that this pool is envisioned to be used concurrently by multiple
 * threads, both the slot and Block are aligned to the size of CPU L1
 * data-cache. This makes sure that we negate the effect of false-sharing
 * (threads bouncing each ones data from cache).
