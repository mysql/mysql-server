/** Sharded key-value store, a convenience wrapper class around Key_value_store
 * that creates N_SHARDS instances of Key_value_store and exposes a simple
 * interface to further manipulate with them. User code, if it wishes so, can
 * opt-in for different key-value implementation or different locking
 * mechanisms. Defaults are provided as convenience.
 *
 * Mapping between a shard and an actual Key_value_store is done at the level of
 * implementation detail of this class and it is done via modulo-arithmethic on
 * THD (connection) identifier. It is guaranteed that the same shard (same
 * Key_value_store instance) will always be returned given the same input: THD
 * (connection) identifier. However, there is no guarantee that there will be
 * only one such mapping (this function is not a bijection).
 *
 * In other words, due to the wrap-around property of modulo-arithmetic
 * and depending on the actual value of N_SHARDS, it is very much possible to
 * get a reference to the same Key_value_store instance for two different THD
 * (connection) identifiers. Thread-safety guarantees are exercised at the
 * level of Key_value_store instance but are controlled through the `Lock`, this
 * class template parameter.
 *
 * Due to aforementioned modulo-arithmethic, and the questionable performance in
 * its more general form, N_SHARDS must be a number which is a power of two.
 * This enables us to implement a modulo operation in single bitwise
 * instruction. Check whether N_SHARDS is a number which is power of two is run
 * during the compile-time.
