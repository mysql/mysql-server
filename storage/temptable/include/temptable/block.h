/** Memory-block abstraction whose purpose is to serve as a building block
 * for custom memory-allocator implementations.
 *
 * TL;DR How it works:
 *  Instantiation:
 *      - With given size and given memory source, Block will allocate memory
 *        and adjust its Header metadata with the relevant information.
 *  Allocation:
 *      - From allocated memory space, Block finds out what is the next
 *        available slot to fit the new Chunk into.
 *      - Creates a new Chunk with the address pointing to that slot.
 *      - Increments the number of allocated chunks.
 *      - Returns a Chunk.
 *  Deallocation:
 *      - Decrements the number of allocated chunks.
 *      - Returns current number of allocated chunks.
 *  Destruction:
 *      - Simply deallocates the memory.
 *
 * Now, more detailed description ...
 *
 * Normally, custom memory-allocators will feed clients' memory allocation
 * and deallocation requests solely through the provided Block interface which
 * enables allocators not to worry about the whole lot of low-level memory
 * byte-juggling but to focus on application-level details.
 *
 * Block, once created, will occupy at-least (see below why) the specified
 * amount of memory after which it will be able to serve client-requested
 * allocations and deallocations in logical units called Chunks. Chunk is
 * an arbitrarily-sized view over a region of memory allocated during the
 * Block creation. Block can fit as many Chunks as there is free memory space
 * left in it. Once there is no free space left, another Block of memory has
 * to be created. Block is not resizeable. E.g. 4KB-sized Block can feed 1x4KB,
 * 2x2KB, 1KB+3KB or any other combination of Chunks whose total size does not
 * exceed the Block size (4KB).
 *
 * Organizing Block memory into Chunks is implementation house-keeping detail
 * stored in its Header metadata region. Block does not maintain the list of
 * Chunks, it only ever keeps the number of currently allocated Chunks and
 * the offset to the first memory location available to feed the next
 * allocation request.
 *
 * While still using the same interface, custom memory-allocators are able to
 * choose where should the Block allocate actual memory from. It could be
 * anything defined by Source but currently only RAM and MMAP-ed files are
 * available and implemented as options.
 *
 * For the benefit of (amortized) constant-time allocations, Block does not
 * re-use or do any other special operations over deallocated Chunks so
 * memory-allocators which will be using it may suffer from block-level
 * memory-fragmentation and consequently higher memory-consumption. Exceptions
 * are deallocations of first and last Chunks in a Block when it is possible
 * to easily re-adjust the offset and therefore be able to re-use that part
 * of memory.
 *
 * Another big advantage, which is very closely related to constant-time
 * allocations, is that it minimizes the number of system-calls required to
 * allocate and deallocate the memory which consequently may lower the
 * process-level memory-fragmentation.
 *
 * Block size does not necessarily end-up being the size originally requested by
 * the client but it will be actually implicitly rounded to the next multiple
 * of CPU word-size which may result in better memory utilization. Actual block
 * size can be queried through the Block interface.
 *
 * To optimize for the CPU memory-access, but also to enable code not to
 * segfault on architectures which do not support unaligned-memory-access
 * (e.g. SPARC), Block will always adjust requested Chunk allocation size to
 * match the size which is rounded to the next multiple of CPU word-size
 * (Block::ALIGN_TO constant). End result is that Block might end up allocating
 * just a few more bytes bigger Chunk than actually requested but that
 * information, however, does not need to be maintained or cared about by the
 * client code.
 *
 * Along with the small space overhead due to the automatic word-size-adjustment
 * of Chunk size, each Block allocation will also have a few bytes overhead for
 * maintaining the Header metadata (Header::SIZE) as well as for maintaining the
 * Chunk metadata (Chunk::METADATA_SIZE). Implementation and data layout details
 * can be found at respective header file declarations.
 *
 * All dirty-implementation details are hidden in Header implementation
 * which makes sure that proper care is taken to handle chunk offsets,
 * available slots, number of present chunks etc. */
