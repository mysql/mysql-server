     Prints out environment errors, adjusting to a variety of options 
     and formats. 
     The printout format can be controlled to print the following optional 
     messages:
     - The environment error message prefix
     - User-supplied prefix obtained by printing ap with the
       fmt string
     - The standard db error string
     The print out takes place via errcall (if set), errfile (if set),
     or stderr if neither is set (and the user so toggles the printout).
     Both errcall and errfile can be set.
     The error message is truncated to approximately 4,000 characters.

     \param env   The environment that the error refers to. 
     \param error The error code
     \param include_stderrstring Controls whether the standard db error 
                  string should be included in the print out
     \param use_stderr_if_nothing_else Toggles the use of stderr.
     \param fmt   Output format for optional prefix arguments (must be NULL
                  if the prefix is empty)
     \param ap    Optional prefix
