/***


Purpose of this test is to stress the checkpoint logic.  

Multiple dictionaries are used.  Data is inserted, checkpoints are taken,
and this test verifies that all checkpoints are valid.  


Parameters:
 -cC crash or not (not crashing useful for running valgrind)
 -i # iteration number (default is to run 5 iterations)
 -n # number of operations per iteration (default 5001)
 -v verbose
 -q quiet

Each iteration does:
 - Verify that previous two iterations were correctly executed
   - Previous inserts were done correctly
   - There are no rows after last expected
 - Take checkpoint
 - Scribble over database (verifying that changes after checkpoint are not effective)
 - Spawn another thread to perform random acts (inserts/deletes/queries) to
   simulate normal database operations
 - Drop dead
