/* Test for #3522.    Show that even with DB_TRYAGAIN, isolation still works.
 * Strategy:
 *  1. Create a tree (with relatively small nodes so things happen quickly, and relatively large compared to the cache).
 *  2. Start two transactions YY and XX.
 *  3. Force XX to precede YY (e.g., XX reads the last row, and then YY deletes it, under MVCC).
 *  4. YY, in a single transaction: deletes everything
 *  5. YY does do a DB_FIRST.
 *     Set things up so that while YY is doing it's retries, XX inserts a row at the beginning.
 *  Make the test terminate by capturing the calls to pread(). */
