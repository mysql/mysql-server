/*****************
 * Purpose: Verify fix for 3113
 * Bug:     Rollback log is checkpointed along with other cachefiles,
 *          but system crashes before checkpoint_end is written to recovery log.
 *          When recovery runs, it uses latest rollback log, which is out of synch
 *          with recovery log.  Latest version of rollback log would be correct for 
 *          last checkpoint if it completed, but version of rollback log needed
 *          is for last complete checkpoint.
 * Fix:     When opening rollback log for recovery, do not use latest, but use 
 *          latest that is no newer than last complete checkpoint.
 * Test:    begin txn
 *          insert
 *          commit
 *          complete checkpoint (no live txns in checkpoint)
 *          begin txn
 *          insert
 *          begin checkpoint (txn in checkpointed rollback log)
 *          crash using callback2 (just before checkpoint_end is written to disk)
 *          attempt to recover, should crash with 3113
