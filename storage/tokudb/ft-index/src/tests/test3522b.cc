/* Test for #3522.    Demonstrate that with DB_TRYAGAIN a cursor can stall.
 * Strategy: Create a tree (with relatively small nodes so things happen quickly, and relatively large compared to the cache).
 *  In a single transaction: Delete everything except the last one, and then do a DB_FIRST.
 *    (Compare to test3522.c which deletes everything including the last one.)
 *  Make the test terminate by capturing the calls to pread(). */
