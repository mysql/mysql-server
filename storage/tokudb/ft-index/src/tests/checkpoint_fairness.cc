// This test fails if the multi_operation_lock prefers readers.  (See #4347).
// But works well if the multi_operation_lock prefers writers (which, since there is typically only one writer, makes it fair).
// What this test does:
//  Starts a bunch of threads (100 seems to work):  Each executes many transactions (and thus obtains the multi_operation_lock during the txn->commit, and until #4346 is changed, holds it through the fsync.  If we fix #4346 then 
//   this test may not be sensitive to the bug.)
//  Meanwhile another thread tries to do W checkpoints.  (W=10 seems to work).
//  The checkpoint thread waits until all the transaction threads have gotten going (waits until each transaction thread has done 10 transactions).
//  The transaction threads get upset if they manage to run for 1000 transactions without the W checkpoints being finished.
//  The theory is that the transaction threads can starve the checkpoint thread by obtaining the multi_operation_lock.
//  But making the multi_operation_lock prefer writers means that the checkpoint gets a chance to run.
