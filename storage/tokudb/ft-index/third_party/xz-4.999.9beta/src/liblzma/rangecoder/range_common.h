/// \brief      Type of probabilities used with range coder
///
/// This needs to be at least 12-bit integer, so uint16_t is a logical choice.
/// However, on some architecture and compiler combinations, a bigger type
/// may give better speed, because the probability variables are accessed
/// a lot. On the other hand, bigger probability type increases cache
/// footprint, since there are 2 to 14 thousand probability variables in
/// LZMA (assuming the limit of lc + lp <= 4; with lc + lp <= 12 there
/// would be about 1.5 million variables).
///
/// With malicious files, the initialization speed of the LZMA decoder can
/// become important. In that case, smaller probability variables mean that
/// there is less bytes to write to RAM, which makes initialization faster.
/// With big probability type, the initialization can become so slow that it
/// can be a problem e.g. for email servers doing virus scanning.
///
/// I will be sticking to uint16_t unless some specific architectures
/// are *much* faster (20-50 %) with uint32_t.
