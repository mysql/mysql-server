/**
 * \brief       Options for BCJ filters
 *
 * The BCJ filters never change the size of the data. Specifying options
 * for them is optional: if pointer to options is NULL, default value is
 * used. You probably never need to specify options to BCJ filters, so just
 * set the options pointer to NULL and be happy.
 *
 * If options with non-default values have been specified when encoding,
 * the same options must also be specified when decoding.
 *
 * \note        At the moment, none of the BCJ filters support
 *              LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH. If LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH is specified,
 *              LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR will be returned. If there is need,
 *              partial support for LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH can be added in future.
 *              Partial means that flushing would be possible only at
 *              offsets that are multiple of 2, 4, or 16 depending on
 *              the filter, except x86 which cannot be made to support
 *              LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH predictably.

	 * offset of the non-first sections so that the relative addresses
	 * of the cross-section branch/call/jump instructions will use the
	 * same absolute addresses as in the first section.

	 * When the pointer to options is NULL, the default value (zero)
	 * is used.
