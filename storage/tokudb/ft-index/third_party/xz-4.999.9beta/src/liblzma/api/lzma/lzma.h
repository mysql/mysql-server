	 * indicate what data to repeat from the dictionary buffer. Thus,

	 * usually is.
	 *
	 * Maximum size of the dictionary depends on multiple things:
	 *  - Memory usage limit
	 *  - Available address space (not a problem on 64-bit systems)
	 *  - Selected match finder (encoder only)
	 *
	 * Currently the maximum dictionary size for encoding is 1.5 GiB

	 * overhead in the decoder, the minimum dictionary size is 4096 bytes.
