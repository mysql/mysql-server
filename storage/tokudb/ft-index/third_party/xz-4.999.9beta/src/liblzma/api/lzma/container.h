 *                      with LZMA_STREAM_INIT.
 * \param       preset  Compression preset to use. A preset consist of level
 *                      number and zero or more flags. Usually flags aren't
 *                      used, so preset is simply a number [0, 9] which match
 *                      the options -0 .. -9 of the xz command line tool.
 *                      Additional flags can be be set using bitwise-or with
 *                      the preset level number, e.g. 6 | LZMA_PRESET_EXTREME.
 * \param       check   Integrity check type to use. See check.h for available
 *                      checks. If you are unsure, use LZMA_CHECK_CRC32.
 *
 * \return      - LZMA_OK: Initialization succeeded. Use lzma_code() to
 *                encode your data.
 *              - LZMA_MEM_ERROR: Memory allocation failed.
 *              - LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR: The given compression level is not
 *                supported by this build of liblzma.
 *              - LZMA_UNSUPPORTED_CHECK: The given check type is not
 *                supported by this liblzma build.
 *              - LZMA_PROG_ERROR: One or more of the parameters have values
 *                that will never be valid. For example, strm == NULL.
 *
 * If initialization fails (return value is not LZMA_OK), all the memory
 * allocated for *strm by liblzma is always freed. Thus, there is no need
 * to call lzma_end() after failed initialization.
 *
 * If initialization succeeds, use lzma_code() to do the actual encoding.
 * Valid values for `action' (the second argument of lzma_code()) are
 * LZMA_RUN, LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH, LZMA_FULL_FLUSH, and LZMA_FINISH. In future,
 * there may be compression levels or flags that don't support LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH.
