.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xzless
.RI [ file ...]
.br
.B lzless
.RI [ file ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B  xzless
is a filter that displays pagefulls of uncompressed text from compressed
file(s) to a terminal.  It works on files compressed with
.BR xz (1)
or
.BR lzma (1).
If no
.I files
are given,
.B xzless
reads from standard input.
.PP
.B xzless
uses
.BR less (1)
as its only pager.  Unlike
.BR xzmore ,
the choice of pagers is not alterable by an environment variable.
Commands are based on both
.BR more (1)
and
.BR vi (1),
and allow back and forth movement and searching.
See the
.BR less (1)
manual for more information.
.PP
The command named
.B lzless
is provided for backward compatibility with LZMA Utils.
