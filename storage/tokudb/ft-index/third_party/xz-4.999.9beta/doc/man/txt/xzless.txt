XZLESS(1)                          XZ Utils                          XZLESS(1)



NAME
       xzless, lzless - view xz or lzma compressed (text) files

SYNOPSIS
       xzless [file...]
       lzless [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       xzless  is  a  filter that displays pagefulls of uncompressed text from
       compressed file(s) to a terminal.  It works on  files  compressed  with
       xz(1)  or  lzma(1).   If no files are given, xzless reads from standard
       input.

       xzless uses less(1) as its only pager.  Unlike xzmore,  the  choice  of
       pagers is not alterable by an environment variable.  Commands are based
       on both more(1) and vi(1),  and  allow  back  and  forth  movement  and
       searching.  See the less(1) manual for more information.

       The  command  named  lzless is provided for backward compatibility with
       LZMA Utils.

ENVIRONMENT
       LESSMETACHARS
              A list of characters special to the shell.  Set by xzless unless
              it is already set in the environment.

       LESSOPEN
              Set  to a command line to invoke the xz(1) decompressor for pre-
              processing the input files to less(1).
