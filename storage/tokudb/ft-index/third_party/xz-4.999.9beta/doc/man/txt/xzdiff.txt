XZDIFF(1)                          XZ Utils                          XZDIFF(1)



NAME
       xzcmp, xzdiff, lzcmp, lzdiff - compare compressed files

SYNOPSIS
       xzcmp [cmp_options] file1 [file2]
       xzdiff [diff_options] file1 [file2]
       lzcmp [cmp_options] file1 [file2]
       lzdiff [diff_options] file1 [file2]

DESCRIPTION
       xzcmp  and  xdiff  invoke  cmp(1)  or  diff(1) on files compressed with
       xz(1), lzma(1), gzip(1), or bzip2(1).  All options specified are passed
       directly to cmp or diff.  If only one file is specified, then the files
       compared are file1 (which must have a suffix of a supported compression
       format)  and  file1  from  which the compression format suffix has been
       stripped.  If two files are specified, then they  are  uncompressed  if
       necessary  and  fed  to cmp(1) or diff(1).  The exit status from cmp or
       diff is preserved.

       The names lzcmp and lzdiff are provided for backward compatibility with
       LZMA Utils.

SEE ALSO
       cmp(1), diff(1), xz(1), gzip(1), bzip2(1), zdiff(1)

BUGS
       Messages  from  the cmp(1) or diff(1) programs refer to temporary file-
       names instead of those specified.
