NAME
       xzmore, lzmore - view xz or lzma compressed (text) files

SYNOPSIS
       xzmore [filename ...]
       lzmore [filename ...]

DESCRIPTION
       xzmore  is  a  filter which allows examination of xz(1) or lzma(1) com-
       pressed text files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.

       To use a pager other than the default more,  set  environment  variable
       PAGER  to the name of the desired program.  The name lzmore is provided
       for backward compatibility with LZMA Utils.

       e or q When the prompt --More--(Next file: file) is printed, this  com-
              mand causes xzmore to exit.

       s      When  the prompt --More--(Next file: file) is printed, this com-
              mand causes xzmore to skip the next file and continue.

       For list of keyboard commands supported while actually viewing the con-
       tent of a file, refer to manual of the pager you use, usually more(1).
