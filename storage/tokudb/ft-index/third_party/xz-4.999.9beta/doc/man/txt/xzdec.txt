XZDEC(1)                           XZ Utils                           XZDEC(1)



NAME
       xzdec, lzmadec - Small .xz and .lzma decompressors

SYNOPSIS
       xzdec [option]...  [file]...
       lzmadec [option]...  [file]...

DESCRIPTION
       xzdec is a liblzma-based decompression-only tool for .xz (and only .xz)
       files.  xzdec is intended to work as a drop-in replacement for xz(1) in
       the  most  common  situations where a script has been written to use xz
       --decompress --stdout (and possibly a few other commonly used  options)
       to  decompress  .xz  files.   lzmadec is identical to xzdec except that
       lzmadec supports .lzma files instead of .xz files.

       To reduce the size of the  executable,  xzdec  doesn't  support  multi-
       threading  or  localization, and doesn't read options from XZ_OPT envi-
       ronment  variable.   xzdec  doesn't  support  displaying   intermediate
       progress  information: sending SIGINFO to xzdec does nothing, but send-
       ing SIGUSR1 terminates  the  process  instead  of  displaying  progress
       information.

OPTIONS
       -d, --decompress, --uncompress
              Ignored for xz(1) compatibility.  xzdec supports only decompres-
              sion.

       -k, --keep
              Ignored for xz(1) compatibility.  xzdec never creates or removes
              any files.

       -c, --stdout, --to-stdout
              Ignored for xz(1) compatibility.  xzdec always writes the decom-
              pressed data to standard output.

       -M limit, --memory=limit
              Set the memory usage limit.  If this option is specified  multi-
              ple times, the last one takes effect. The limit can be specified
              in multiple ways:

              o  The limit can be an absolute value in bytes. Using an integer
                 suffix like MiB can be useful. Example: --memory=80MiB

              o  The  limit  can be specified as a percentage of physical RAM.
                 Example: --memory=70%

              o  The limit can be reset back to its default  value  (currently
                 40 % of physical RAM) by setting it to 0.

              o  The memory usage limiting can be effectively disabled by set-
                 ting limit to max.  This isn't recommended. It's usually bet-
                 ter to use, for example, --memory=90%.

              The  current  limit can be seen near the bottom of the output of
              the --help option.

       -q, --quiet
              Specifying this once does nothing since xzdec never displays any
              warnings or notices.  Specify this twice to suppress errors.

       -Q, --no-warn
              Ignored for xz(1) compatibility.  xzdec never uses the exit sta-
              tus 2.

       -h, --help
              Display a help message and exit successfully.

       -V, --version
              Display the version number of xzdec and liblzma.

EXIT STATUS
       0      All was good.

       1      An error occurred.

       xzdec doesn't have any warning messages like xz(1) has, thus  the  exit
       status 2 is not used by xzdec.

NOTES
       xzdec  and  lzmadec  are not really that small. The size can be reduced
       further by dropping features from liblzma at  compile  time,  but  that
       shouldn't  usually  be done for executables distributed in typical non-
       embedded operating system distributions. If you need a truly small  .xz
       decompressor, consider using XZ Embedded.
