  CLAIMS.  This grant does not include claims that would be infringed
  only as a consequence of further modifications of THIS
  IMPLEMENTATION.  If you or your agent or licensee institute or order

/* The goal of this test:  Make sure that when we aggressively promote 
 * that we don't get a fencepost error on the size.  (#399, I think)

 * 
 * For various values of I do the following:
 *
 *   Make a tree of height 3 (that is, the root is of height 2)
 *   use small nodes (say 4KB)
 *   you have this tree:
 *                   A
 *                     B
 *                      C0 C1 C2 .. C15
 *   A has only one child.  B has as many children as it can get.
 *   Fill the C nodes (the leaves) all almost full.
 *   Fill B's buffer up with a big message X for C15, and a slightly smaller message Y for C1.
 *   Put into A's buffer a little message Z aimed at C0.
 *   Now when insert a message of size I aimed at C0.  I and Z together are too big to fit in A.
 *   First: X will be pushed into C15, resulting in this split
 *    A
 *     B0
 *       C0 C1 ... C8
 *     B1
 *       C9 C10 ... C15 C16
 *   At this point C0 through C14 are full, Y is in B0's buffer, and A's buffer contains I and Z.
 *   So we try to push Z if it fits.  Which it does.
 *   So then we try to I if it fits.  If we calculated wrong, everything  breaks now.
