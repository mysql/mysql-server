//  This layer of abstraction (xids_xxx) understands xids<> and nothing else.
//  It contains all the functions that understand xids<>
//
//  xids<> do not store the implicit transaction id of 0 at index 0.
//  The accessor functions make the id of 0 explicit at index 0.
//  The number of xids physically stored in the xids array is in
//  the variable num_xids.
//
// The xids struct is immutable.  The caller gets an initial version of XIDS
// by calling toku_xids_get_root_xids(), which returns the constant struct
// representing the root transaction (id 0).  When a transaction begins, 
// a new XIDS is created with the id of the current transaction appended to
// the list.
// 
//

// This is the xids list for a transactionless environment.
// It is also the initial state of any xids list created for
// nested transactions.
