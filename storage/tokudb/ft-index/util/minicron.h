// Specification:
// A minicron is a miniature cron job for executing a job periodically inside a pthread.
// To create a minicron,
//   1) allocate a "struct minicron" somewhere.
//      Rationale:  This struct can be stored inside another struct (such as the cachetable), avoiding a malloc/free pair.
//   2) call toku_minicron_setup, specifying a period (in milliseconds), a function, and some arguments.
//      If the period is positive then the function is called periodically (with the period specified)
//      Note: The period is measured from when the previous call to f finishes to when the new call starts.
//            Thus, if the period is 5 minutes, and it takes 8 minutes to run f, then the actual periodicity is 13 minutes.
//      Rationale:  If f always takes longer than f to run, then it will get "behind".  This module makes getting behind explicit.
//   3) When finished, call toku_minicron_shutdown.
//   4) If you want to change the period, then call toku_minicron_change_period.    The time since f finished is applied to the new period
//      and the call is rescheduled.  (If the time since f finished is more than the new period, then f is called immediately).
