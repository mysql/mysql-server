//
// Overview: A growable array is a little bit like std::vector except that
//  it doesn't have constructors (hence can be used in static constructs, since
//  the google style guide says no constructors), and it's a little simpler.
// Operations:
//   init and deinit (we don't have constructors and destructors).
//   fetch_unchecked to get values out.
//   store_unchecked to put values in.
//   push to add an element at the end
//   get_size to find out the size
//   get_memory_size to find out how much memory the data stucture is using.
//
//******************************************************************************
