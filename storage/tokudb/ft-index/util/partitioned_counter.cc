// Representation: The representation of a partitioned counter comprises a
//  sum, called sum_of_dead; an index, called the ckey, which indexes into a
//  thread-local array to find a thread-local part of the counter; and a
//  linked list of thread-local parts.
//
//  There is also a linked list, for each thread that has a thread-local part
//  of any counter, of all the thread-local parts of all the counters.
//
//  There is a pthread_key which gives us a hook to clean up thread-local
//  state when a thread terminates.  For each thread-local part of a counter
//  that the thread has, we add in the thread-local sum into the sum_of_dead.
//
//  Finally there is a list of all the thread-local arrays so that when we
//  destroy the partitioned counter before the threads are done, we can find
//  and destroy the thread_local_arrays before destroying the pthread_key.
//
// Abstraction function: The sum is represented by the sum of _sum and the
//  sum's of the thread-local parts of the counter.
//
// Representation invariant: Every thread-local part is in the linked list of
//  the thread-local parts of its counter, as well as in the linked list of
//  the counters of a the thread.

//   But the problem is that the counter can be destroyed before threads
//   terminate, or maybe a thread terminates before the counter is destroyed.
//   If the counter is destroyed first, then the mutex is no longer available.
