// The circular buffer manages an array of elements as a thread-safe FIFO queue.
// It does not allocate its own space, or grow the space it manages.
// Access to the circular buffer is managed by a mutex.
// The blocking operations are managed by condition variables.  They are as fairly scheduled as the threading library supports.
//
// Sample usage:
//   int array[2]
//   circular_buffer<int> intbuf;
//   intbuf.init(array, 2);
//
//   // thread A
//   intbuf.push(1);

//
//   // thread B
//   int a = intbuf.pop();  // <- 1

    // Returns:
