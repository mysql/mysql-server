PATENT RIGHTS GRANT:

  "THIS IMPLEMENTATION" means the copyrightable works distributed by
  Tokutek as part of the Fractal Tree project.

  "PATENT CLAIMS" means the claims of patents that are owned or
  licensable by Tokutek, both currently or in the future; and that in
  the absence of this license would be infringed by THIS
  IMPLEMENTATION or by using or running THIS IMPLEMENTATION.

  "PATENT CHALLENGE" shall mean a challenge to the validity,
  patentability, enforceability and/or non-infringement of any of the
  PATENT CLAIMS or otherwise opposing any of the PATENT CLAIMS.

  Tokutek hereby grants to you, for the term and geographical scope of
  the PATENT CLAIMS, a non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
  irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to
  make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and
  otherwise run, modify, and propagate the contents of THIS
  IMPLEMENTATION, where such license applies only to the PATENT
  CLAIMS.  This grant does not include claims that would be infringed
  only as a consequence of further modifications of THIS
  IMPLEMENTATION.  If you or your agent or licensee institute or order
  or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any entity
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
  THIS IMPLEMENTATION constitutes direct or contributory patent
  infringement, or inducement of patent infringement, then any rights
  granted to you under this License shall terminate as of the date
  such litigation is filed.  If you or your agent or exclusive
