/**
  For a given PFS_class_type, and a name within that class, return the
  version-dependent alias for that name.

  This is used when registering performance_schema names, to check if
  there are any alternative names. If there are, those are stored in
  the PFS_instr_class object. Later, when the name is required
  (e.g. during the execution of SELECT * FROM
  performance_schema.threads statement), it decides which name to use
  based on the value of @@session.terminology_use_previous
  and the fields that were stored in PFS_instr_class.

  This framework is extensible, so in future versions we can rename
  more names, and user will be able to choose exactly which version's
  names will be used.  However, note that the framework currently does
  not support successive changes of *the same* identifier.  This
  limitation allows us to return just a singleton compatible_name_t
  from this function.  If, in the future, we need to make successive
  changes to the same identifier, this function needs to be changed so
  that it returns something like a std::map<ulong, char*>, for a given
  instrumented object mapping versions to alternative names.

  @param class_type The PFS_class_type of 'str', indicating whether it
  is a mutex/rwlock/condition variable/memory allocation/thread
  name/thread stage/thread command/etc.

  @param str The object name to check.

  @param use_prefix If true, 'str' is expected to begin with the
  prefix for 'class_type', and the return value will include the
  prefix.  If false, 'str' is not expected to begin with the prefix
  and the return value will not include the prefix.

  @retval A compatible_name_t object. If there is an alternative name,
  'old_name' points to a static buffer containing that name, and
  'version' represents the enum_compatibility_version where that name
  was introduced.  If there is no alternative name, 'old_name' is
  nullptr and version is 0.
