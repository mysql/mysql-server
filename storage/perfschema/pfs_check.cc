  Check that the performance schema tables

  Discrepancies are written in the server log,
  but are not considered fatal, so this function does not
  return an error code:
  - some differences are compatible, and should not cause a failure
  - some differences are not compatible, but then the DBA needs an operational
  server to be able to DROP+CREATE the tables with the proper structure,
  as part of the initial server installation or during an upgrade.
  In case of discrepancies, later attempt to perform DML against
  the performance schema will be rejected with an error.
