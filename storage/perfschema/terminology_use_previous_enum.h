/**
  In respect to the organization of modules, this really belongs in
  terminology_use_previous.h.  However, that would create a
  cyclic dependency between header files:

  - enum_compatibility_version is needed in pfs_instr_class.h

  - PFS_class_type is defined in pfs_instr_class.h and needed in
    instrumentation_class_compatibility.h

  So we keep enum_compatibility_version in its own header, included
  from both the other headers, to avoid the cyclicity.
