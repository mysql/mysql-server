This is the FederatedX Storage Engine, developed as an external storage engine.

NOTE:

The following is only relevant if you use it for MySQL.  MariaDB already comes
with the latest version of FederatedX.

To install, grab a copy of the mysql source code and run this:

./configure --with-mysql=/path/to/src/mysql-5.x --libdir=/usr/local/lib/mysql/

make install

And then inside of MySQL:

mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN federatedx SONAME 'libfederatedx_engine.so';

mysql> CREATE TABLE `d` (`a` varchar(125), b text, primary key(a)) ENGINE=FEDERATEDX CONNECTION="mysql://root@host/schema/table"

or 

mysql> CREATE TABLE `d` (`a` varchar(125), b text, primary key(a)) ENGINE=FEDERATEDX CONNECTION="server" CHARSET=latin1;

You will probably need to edit the Makefile.am in the src/ tree if you want
to build on anything other then Linux (and the Makefile assumes that the
server was not compiled for debug). The reason for the two possible
configure lines is that libdir is dependent on where MySQL was installed. If
you run the "INSTALL PLUGIN ..." and you get a file not found, check that
your configured this directory correctly.

For Solaris you can enable DTrace probes by adding to configure
--enable-dtrace
