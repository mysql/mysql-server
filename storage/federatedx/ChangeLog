  - Fixed bug #30051 "CREATE TABLE does not connect and check existence of remote table"
    Modified "real_connect" to take a share and create flag to in order to not rely
    on any settings that are later instantiated and/or set by get_share
    Also, put logic in the code to not attempt this if a localhost. There's an annoying
    functionality that if federated tries to connect to itself during creater table, you 
    get 1159 error (timeout) - only when local. This prevents having this functionality
    and is probably part of the reason it was removed.
