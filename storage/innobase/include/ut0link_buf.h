 Link buffer - concurrent data structure which allows:
         - concurrent addition of links
         - single-threaded tracking of connected path created by links
         - limited size of window with holes (missing links)

/** Concurrent data structure, which allows to track concurrently
performed operations which locally might be dis-ordered.

This data structure is informed about finished concurrent operations
and tracks up to which point in a total order all operations have
been finished (there are no holes).

It also allows to limit the last period in which there might be holes.
These holes refer to unfinished concurrent operations, which precede
in the total order some operations that are already finished.

Threads might concurrently report finished operations (lock-free).

Threads might ask for maximum currently known position in total order,
up to which all operations are already finished (lock-free).

Single thread might track the reported finished operations and update
maximum position in total order, up to which all operations are done.

You might look at current usages of this data structure in log0buf.cc.
