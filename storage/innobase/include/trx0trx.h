/** Latching protocol for trx_lock_t::que_state.  trx_lock_t::que_state
 captures the state of the query thread during the execution of a query.
 This is different from a transaction state. The query state of a transaction
 can be updated asynchronously by other threads.  The other threads can be
 system threads, like the timeout monitor thread or user threads executing
 other queries. Another thing to be mindful of is that there is a delay between
 when a query thread is put into LOCK_WAIT state and before it actually starts
 waiting.  Between these two events it is possible that the query thread is
 granted the lock it was waiting for, which implies that the state can be
 changed asynchronously.

 All these operations take place within the context of locking. Therefore state
 changes within the locking code must latch the shard with the wait_lock and
 the trx->mutex when changing trx->lock.que_state to TRX_QUE_LOCK_WAIT or
 trx->lock.wait_lock to non-NULL but when the lock wait ends it is sufficient
 to only acquire the trx->mutex.

  It is possible that the transaction has trx->lock.wait_lock == nullptr, yet it
  has non-null value of trx->lock.blocking_trx. For example this can happen when
  we are in the process of moving locks from one heap_no to another. This
  however is always done while the lock_sys shards which contain the queues
  involved are latched and conceptually it is true that the blocking_trx is
  the one for which the transaction waits, even though temporarily there is no
  pointer to a particular WAITING lock object.

  Changes from non-NULL to NULL while latching the shard containing the old

  Never changes from non-NULL to other non-NULL directly.

  Readers should hold exclusive global latch on lock_sys, as in general they

  This field is not cleared when wait_lock is set to NULL during
  lock_reset_lock_and_trx_wait() as in lock_wait_suspend_thread() we are
  interested in reporting the last known value of this field via
  thd_wait_begin(). When a thread has to wait for a lock, it first releases
  lock-sys latch, and then calls lock_wait_suspend_thread() where among other
  things it tries to report statistic via thd_wait_begin() about the kind of
  lock (THD_WAIT_ROW_LOCK vs THD_WAIT_TABLE_LOCK) that caused the wait. But
  there is a possibility that before it gets to call thd_wait_begin() some other
  thread could latch lock-sys and grant the lock and call
  lock_reset_lock_and_trx_wait(). In other words: in case another thread was
  quick enough to grant the lock, we still would like to report the reason for
  attempting to sleep.
  Another common scenario of "setting trx->lock.wait_lock to NULL" is page
  reorganization: when we have to move records between pages, we also move
  locks, and when doing so, we temporarily remove the old waiting lock, and then
  add another one. For example look at lock_rec_move_low(). It first calls
  lock_reset_lock_and_trx_wait() which changes trx->lock.wait_lock to NULL, but
  then calls lock_rec_add_to_queue() -> RecLock::create() -> RecLock::lock_add()
  -> lock_set_lock_and_trx_wait() to set it again to the new lock. This all
  happens while holding lock-sys latch, but we read wait_lock_type without this
  latch, so we should not clear the wait_lock_type simply because somebody
  changed wait_lock to NULL.

acquiring the dict_operation_lock before starting the subtransaction
and releasing it after committing the subtransaction.

* The purge system uses a special transaction that is not associated
with any session.

* If the system crashed or it was quickly shut down while there were
transactions in the ACTIVE or PREPARED state, these transactions would
no longer be associated with a session when the server is restarted.

A session may be served by at most one thread at a time. The serving
thread of a session might change in some MySQL implementations.
Therefore we do not have std::this_thread::get_id() assertions in the code.

Normally, only the thread that is currently associated with a running
transaction may access (read and modify) the trx object, and it may do
so without holding any mutex. The following are exceptions to this:

* trx_rollback_resurrected() may access resurrected (connectionless)
transactions while the system is already processing new user
transactions. The trx_sys->mutex prevents a race condition between it
and lock_trx_release_locks() [invoked by trx_commit()].

* Print of transactions may access transactions not associated with
the current thread. The caller must be holding trx_sys->mutex and
exclusive global lock_sys latch.

* When a transaction handle is in the trx_sys->mysql_trx_list or
trx_sys->trx_list, some of its fields must not be modified without
holding trx_sys->mutex exclusively.

* The locking code (in particular, deadlock checking and implicit to
explicit conversion) will access transactions associated to other
connections. The locks of transactions are protected by lock_sys latches
and sometimes by trx->mutex.

* Killing of asynchronous transactions. */

  /** State of the trx from the point of view of concurrency control
  and the valid state transitions.

  Possible states:

  TRX_STATE_NOT_STARTED
  TRX_STATE_FORCED_ROLLBACK
  TRX_STATE_ACTIVE
  TRX_STATE_PREPARED
  TRX_STATE_COMMITTED_IN_MEMORY (alias below COMMITTED)

  Valid state transitions are:

  Regular transactions:
  * NOT_STARTED -> ACTIVE -> COMMITTED -> NOT_STARTED

  Auto-commit non-locking read-only:
  * NOT_STARTED -> ACTIVE -> NOT_STARTED

  XA (2PC):
  * NOT_STARTED -> ACTIVE -> PREPARED -> COMMITTED -> NOT_STARTED

  Recovered XA:
  * NOT_STARTED -> PREPARED -> COMMITTED -> (freed)

  XA (2PC) (shutdown or disconnect before ROLLBACK or COMMIT):
  * NOT_STARTED -> PREPARED -> (freed)

  Disconnected XA can become recovered:
  * ... -> ACTIVE -> PREPARED (connected) -> PREPARED (disconnected)
  Disconnected means from mysql e.g due to the mysql client disconnection.
  Latching and various transaction lists membership rules:

  XA (2PC) transactions are always treated as non-autocommit.

  Transitions to ACTIVE or NOT_STARTED occur when
  !in_rw_trx_list (no trx_sys->mutex needed).

  Autocommit non-locking read-only transactions move between states
  without holding any mutex. They are !in_rw_trx_list.

  All transactions, unless they are determined to be ac-nl-ro,
  explicitly tagged as read-only or read-write, will first be put
  on the read-only transaction list. Only when a !read-only transaction
  in the read-only list tries to acquire an X or IX lock on a table
  do we remove it from the read-only list and put it on the read-write
  list. During this switch we assign it a rollback segment.

  When a transaction is NOT_STARTED, it can be in_mysql_trx_list if
  it is a user transaction. It cannot be in rw_trx_list.

  ACTIVE->PREPARED->COMMITTED is only possible when trx->in_rw_trx_list.
  The transition ACTIVE->PREPARED is protected by trx_sys->mutex.

  ACTIVE->COMMITTED is possible when the transaction is in
  rw_trx_list.

  Transitions to COMMITTED are protected by trx->mutex.

  NOTE: Some of these state change constraints are an overkill,
  currently only required for a consistent view for printing stats.
  This unnecessarily adds a huge cost for the general case. */
