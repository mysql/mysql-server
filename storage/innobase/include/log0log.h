New redo log files are created in following cases:
  - there are no existing redo log files in the log directory,
  - existing set of redo log files is not marked as fully initialized
    (flag LOG_HEADER_FLAG_NOT_INITIALIZED exists in the newest file).

After this call, the log_sys global variable is allocated and initialized.

@remarks
The redo log files are not resized in this function, because before resizing
log files, InnoDB must run recovery and ensure log files are logically empty.
The redo resize is currently the only scenario in which the initialized log_sys
might become closed by log_sys_close() and then re-initialized by another call
to log_sys_init().

@note Note that the redo log system is NOT ready for user writes after this
call is finished. The proper order of calls looks like this:
        - log_sys_init(),
