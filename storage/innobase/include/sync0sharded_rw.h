/** Rw-lock with very fast, highly concurrent s-lock but slower x-lock.
It's basically array of rw-locks. When s-lock is being acquired, single
rw-lock from array is selected randomly and s-locked. Therefore, all
rw-locks from array has to be x-locked when x-lock is being acquired.

Purpose of this data structure is to reduce contention on single atomic
in single rw-lock when a lot of threads need to acquire s-lock very often,
but x-lock is very rare. */
