      the requested alignment.

      It is guaranteed that storage allocated by this functor is always
      (size + alignment) big _and_ that there is always
      alignof(std::max_align_t) spare bytes within that segment which can be
      freely used. This means that pointer which is returned by this function
      can always be safely reversed by alignof(std::max_align_t) bytes and hence
      make this sub-segment accessible to any subsequent implementation.

      Reversing the pointer for a value which is bigger than
      alignof(std::max_align_t) bytes is in certain cases possible and can be
      checked by inspecting the returned offset value. Some more specialized
      implementations can take advantage of that fact too.

      This property is very important because it can be taken advantage of by
      other implementations so they are able to store whatever metadata they
      would like into this segment of alignof(std::max_align_t) bytes, or FWIW
      (pointer - offset) bytes in more specialized cases.

      For example, let's say that size=10, alignment=32, and underlying
      allocation function used by this function implementation returns a pointer
      at address 128. This address must be a multiple of
      alignof(std::max_align_t) which in this example is 16.

           ------------------------------
           128      144       160     170

      DATA is an actual data which has been requested with given size (10) and
      alignment (32).
      META is the alignof(std::max_align_t) segment that can always be freely
      used by other implementations.
      VARLEN is the leftover variable-length segment that specialized
      implementations can further make use of by deducing its size from returned
      offset.

      See Aligned_alloc and Aligned_alloc_arr implementations to see an example
      of how META segment can be used.

    // guaranteed to return suitably aligned pointer P. In other words, this
    // means that pointer P will be aligned to the value of
    // alignof(std::max_align_t). That value on Linux implementations is
    // typically 8 bytes (x86) or 16 bytes (x86-64) but this is completely
    // implementation-defined. Windows implementation, for example, defines this
    // value to be 8 bytes for both x86 _and_ x86-64.
    //
    // Question which arises is how many bytes do we need to ask std::malloc in
    // order to satisfy the requested alignment, A, and requested size, S.
    //
    // Short answer is (size + alignment) and you can skip the following section
    // if you're not interested in how we got to that value.
    //
    // Long answer is that we can model the problem mathematically as follows:
    //    A = alignment
    //    S = size
    //    P = std::malloc(N);
    //    P % alignof(std::max_align_t) = 0;

    //    N is our unknown and for which we can only say that:
    //      N = S + K
    //    is true where K is also some unknown value.
    //
    // (A) In cases when P % A = 0, we know that we are already at suitable
    // address so we can deduce that:
    //    K = 0
    // from which it follows that:
    //    N = S + K = S
    //
    // (B) In cases when P % A != 0, our K must be sufficiently large so that
    //    <P, P + K]
    // range contains value, P', so that
    //    P' % A = 0
    // If K = A, then
    //    <P, P + A]
    // which can be expanded as
    //    <P, P + 1, P + 2, P + 3, ..., P + A]
    //
    // If we know that
    //    P % A != 0
    // then we also know that
    //    (P + A) % A = P % A + A % A = P % A + 0 = P % A != 0
    // which implies that our P' value is in
    //    <P, P + A>
    // range.
    //
    // Given that
    //    P % alignof(std::max_align_t) = 0
    //    P' % A = 0
    //    A % alignof(std::max_align_t) = 0
    //    P' % alignof(std::max_align_t) = 0
    // it follows that our P' value can only be found at
    //    P' = P + L*alignof(std::max_align_t)
    // increments where L is some constant value in range of
    //    L = [1, x>
    // Expanding <P, P + A> into what we know so far:
    //    <P, ..., P + L*alignof(std::max_align_t), ..., P + A>
    // it follows that
    //    P + L*alignof(std::max_align_t) < P + A
    // which equals to
    //    L*alignof(std::max_align_t) < A
    //
    // We now just need to prove that
    //    L*alignof(std::max_align_t) < A
    // is always true for some L value in which case this would mean that our
    // <P, P + A> range contains at least one value for which P' % = 0.
    //
    // Picking the first available L value from L = [1, x> range,
    // we will get
    //    1*alignof(std::max_align_t) < A
    // Given that
    //    A > 2*alignof(std::max_align_t) - 1
    // must be true, it follows that
    //    1*alignof(std::max_align_t) < 2*alignof(std::max_align_t) - 1 < A

    VARLEN1 and ALIGNED-ALLOC-META are direct byproduct of Aligned_alloc_impl
    (and Aligned_alloc_metadata) layout and guarantees.

    VARLEN1 is the leftover variable-length segment that specialized
    implementations can further make use of by deducing its size from returned
    offset. Not used by this implementation.

    DATALEN field in ALIGNED-ALLOC-META segment encodes the total length of DATA
    segment, which is the actual allocation size that client code has requested.

    VARLEN1-OFFSET in ALIGNED-ALLOC-META segment encodes the offset to VARLEN1
    segment which represents the original pointer obtained by underlying
    allocation Aligned_alloc_impl mechanism.

    PFS-META, VARLEN2 and PFS-META-OFFSET are memory layout representation of
    PFS_metadata.

    OWNER field encode the owning thread. DATALEN' field encodes total size
    of memory consumed and not only the size of the DATA segment. KEY field
    encodes the PFS/PSI key.

    VARLEN2 is the leftover variable-length segment that specialized
    implementations can further make use of by deducing its size from the
    following formulae: requested_alignment - sizeof(PFS-META-OFFSET) -
    sizeof(PFS-META). In code that would be alignment -
    PFS_metadata::size. Not used by this implementation.

    PFS-META-OFFSET is a field which allows us to recover the pointer to
    PFS-META segment from a pointer to DATA segment. Having a pointer to
    PFS-META segment allows us to deduce the VARLEN1-OFFSET field from
    ALIGNED-ALLOC-META segment which finally gives us a pointer obtained by the
    underlying allocation Aligned_alloc_impl mechanism.
