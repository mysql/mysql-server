Determines if it is possible to remove a secondary index entry.
Removal is possible if the secondary index entry does not refer to any
not delete marked version of a clustered index record where DB_TRX_ID
is newer than the purge view.

NOTE: This function should only be called by the purge thread, only
while holding a latch on the leaf page of the secondary index entry
(or keeping the buffer pool watch on the page).  It is possible that
this function first returns true and then false, if a user transaction
inserts a record that the secondary index entry would refer to.
However, in that case, the user transaction would also re-insert the
secondary index entry after purge has removed it and released the leaf
page latch.
