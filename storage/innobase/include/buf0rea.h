/** Applies linear read-ahead if in the buf_pool the page is a border page of
a linear read-ahead area and all the pages in the area have been accessed.
Does not read any page if the read-ahead mechanism is not activated. Note
that the algorithm looks at the 'natural' adjacent successor and
predecessor of the page, which on the leaf level of a B-tree are the next
and previous page in the chain of leaves. To know these, the page specified
in (space, offset) must already be present in the buf_pool. Thus, the
natural way to use this function is to call it when a page in the buf_pool
is accessed the first time, calling this function just after it has been
bufferfixed.
NOTE 1: as this function looks at the natural predecessor and successor
fields on the page, what happens, if these are not initialized to any
sensible value? No problem, before applying read-ahead we check that the
area to read is within the span of the space, if not, read-ahead is not
applied. An uninitialized value may result in a useless read operation, but
only very improbably.
NOTE 2: the calling thread may own latches on pages: to avoid deadlocks this
function must be written such that it cannot end up waiting for these
latches!
NOTE 3: the calling thread must want access to the page given: this rule is
set to prevent unintended read-aheads performed by ibuf routines, a situation
which could result in a deadlock if the OS does not support asynchronous io.
