/** Waits in loop until a provided condition is satisfied. Combines usage
of spin-delay and event.

@remarks

First it uses a spin loop with PAUSE instructions. In each spin iteration
it checks the condition and stops as soon as it returned true.

When a provided number of spin iterations is reached, and the condition
still has not returned true, waiting on a provided event starts.

Each wait uses a provided timeout. After each wake-up the condition is
re-checked and function stops as soon as the condition returned true.

Every k-waits (ended on wake-up or timeout), the timeout is multiplied by two
(but it's limited up to maximum value of 100ms).

@param[in,out]	event			event on which function may wait
@param[in]	spins_limit		maximum spin iterations
@param[in]	timeout			initial timeout value
@param[in]	timeout_mul2_every	timeout is multiplied by two every
                                        that many waits on event
@param[in]	condition		returns true when condition is
                                        satisfied
