further than to the start_lsn, until a link start_lsn -> end_lsn
has been added to the log recent written buffer.

NOTE that the link is added after data is written to the reserved
space in the log buffer. It is very critical to do all these steps
as fast as possible, because very likely the log writer thread is
waiting for the link.
