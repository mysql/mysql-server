/** @file include/os0once.h
 A class that aids executing a given function exactly once in a multi-threaded

/** Execute a given function exactly once in a multi-threaded environment
or wait for the function to be executed by another thread.

Example usage:
First the user must create a control variable of type os_once::state_t and
assign it os_once::NEVER_DONE.
Then the user must pass this variable, together with a function to be
executed to os_once::do_or_wait_for_done().

Multiple threads can call os_once::do_or_wait_for_done() simultaneously with
the same (os_once::state_t) control variable. The provided function will be
called exactly once and when os_once::do_or_wait_for_done() returns then this
function has completed execution, by this or another thread. In other words
os_once::do_or_wait_for_done() will either execute the provided function or
will wait for its execution to complete if it is already called by another
thread or will do nothing if the function has already completed its execution
earlier.

This mimics pthread_once(3), but unfortunately pthread_once(3) does not
support passing arguments to the init_routine() function. We should use
std::call_once() when we start compiling with C++11 enabled. */
