call this before it has produced LOG_CHECKPOINT_FREE_PER_THREAD * UNIV_PAGE_SIZE
bytes of redo log records. That's because that is the margin in redo log we
reserve by calling this function.

@remarks
Checks if current log.sn exceeds log.free_check_limit_sn, in which case
waits (until it does not exceed). This function is called before starting
a mini-transaction, because thread must not hold block latches when calling
this function. It is also important that the caller does NOT hold any latch,
that might be tried to be acquired:
  - by the page cleaner (e.g. page/block latches),
  - or by the log flush process (e.g. file space latches),
  - or by any other thread, which might at that time already hold another
    latch, that could further lead to a similar problem in chain of threads.
For example, suppose a thread holding some latch X, which is neither used by
the page cleaners nor by the log flush process, called log_free_check() and
started to wait for the free space. Another thread, holding block's latch
(which obviously might be needed for the page cleaners) tries to acquire the
latch X. It needs to wait, because X has already been taken. Therefore, the
latched block cannot be flushed. If this block had old modifications
(low oldest_modification), it could effectively prevent any further attempts
to reclaim space in the redo log. The chain of waiting for each other threads
could obviously be even longer than the one in example. Therefore it is very
important not to call log_free_check() if we are holding any latchs which
might exist in any of such chains. As you can see, it is not that easy to see
if log_free_check() might be called. It is not only about direct holding
of block latches, but also such X (or Y acquired by thread holding such X),
could lead to a deadlock.

For sake of simplicity, you should better not keep any latch when calling to
the log_free_check() unless you are really sure about what you are doing. */
