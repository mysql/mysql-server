    inserts. This is used when migrating all elements of an array to the

  * real key: anything other than the above means this is a real key,

* The possible values are:
  * NOT_FOUND: a (key, val = NOT_FOUND) tuple means that it is just being
    inserted and returning "not found" is ok. This is the initial state of all
    values.
  * DELETED: a (key, val = DELETED) tuple means that a tuple with this key
    existed before but was deleted at some point. Searches for this key return
    "not found" and inserts reuse the tuple, replacing the DELETED value with
    something else.
  * GOTO_NEXT_ARRAY: a (key, val = GOTO_NEXT_ARRAY) tuple means that the
    searches for this tuple (get and insert) should go to the next array and
    repeat the search there. Used when migrating all tuples from one array to
    the next.
  * real value: anything other than the above means this is a real value,

  * UNUSED -> real key -- allowed
  * UNUSED -> AVOID -- allowed
