  Note: I was tempted to declare `infos` as `static`, or at least
  declare it in lock_wait_timeout_thread() and reuse the same instance
  over and over again to avoid allocator calls caused by push_back()
  calls inside lock_wait_snapshot_waiting_threads() while we hold
  lock_sys->lock_wait_mutex. I was afraid, that allocator might need
  to block on some internal mutex in order to synchronize with other
  threads using allocator, and this could in turn cause contention on
  lock_wait_mutex. I hoped, that since vectors never shrink,
  and only grow, then keeping a single instance of `infos` alive for the whole
  lifetime of the thread should increase performance, because after some
  initial period of growing, the allocations will never have to occur again.
  But, I've run many many various experiments, with/without static,
  with infos declared outside, with reserve(n) using various values of n
  (128, srv_max_n_threads, even a simple ML predictor), and nothing, NOTHING
  was faster than just using local vector as we do here (at least on
  tetra01, tetra02, when comparing ~70 runs of each algorithm on uniform,
  pareto, 128 and 1024 usrs).
  This was counter-intuitive to me, so I've checked how malloc is implemented
  and it turns out that modern malloc is a variant of ptmalloc2 and uses a
  large number of independent arenas (larger than number of threads), and
  various smart heuristics to map threads to these arenas in a way which
  avoids blocking.
  So, before changing the way we handle allocation of memory in these
  lock_wait_* routines, please, PLEASE, first check empirically if it really
  helps by running many tests and checking for statistical significance,
  as variance seems to be large.
  (And the downside of using `static` is that it is not very obvious
  how our custom deallocator, which tries to update some stats, would
  behave during shutdown).
  Anyway, in case some tests will indicate that taking a snapshot is a
  bottleneck, one can check if declaring this vectors as static solves the
  issue.
