 ON. When set, we want to wait in the queue for as little time as possible.
 However, very short waits will result in a lot of context switches and that
 is also not desirable. When threads need to sleep multiple times we increment
 os_thread_sleep_delay by one. When we see threads getting a slot without
 waiting and there are no other threads waiting in the queue, we try and reduce
 the wait as much as we can. Currently we reduce it by half each time. If the
 thread only had to wait for one turn before it was able to enter InnoDB we
 decrement it by one. This is to try and keep the sleep time stable around the
 "optimum" sleep time. */
