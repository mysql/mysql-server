 * The MOCK storage engine is used for testing MySQL server functionality

 *
 * There are currently no secondary storage engines mature enough to be merged
 * into mysql-trunk. Therefore, this bare-minimum storage engine, with no
 * actual functionality and implementing only the absolutely necessary handler
 * interfaces to allow setting it as a secondary engine of a table, was created
 * to facilitate pushing MySQL server code changes to mysql-trunk with test
 * coverage without depending on ongoing work of other storage engines.
 *
 * @note This mock storage engine does not support being set as a primary
 * storage engine.
