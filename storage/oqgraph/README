OQGraph storage engine
Copyright (C) 2007-2009 Arjen G Lentz & Antony T Curtis for Open Query

The Open Query GRAPH engine (OQGRAPH) is a computation engine allowing
hierarchies and more complex graph structures to be handled in a
relational fashion. In a nutshell, tree structures and
friend-of-a-friend style searches can now be done using standard SQL
syntax, and results joined onto other tables.

See http://openquery.com/graph for more information.


INSTALLATION

OQGraph requires at least version 1.40.0 of the Boost library. To
