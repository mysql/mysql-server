*** COMPILING ON WINDOWS ***
As of 2014, FastBit source code starts to make use of some C++11x
features that are not supported yet in MS Visual Studio, therefore,
there is no way to compile with Visual Studio until C++0x is
supported.  However, it is possible to compile with CYGWIN or MinGW.
****************************


FastBit is packaged with GNU build tools.  In most cases, this means you
only need to run

./configure && make

to build the library and the examples.  The following instructions are
for customization and trouble-shooting your configuration and building
process.

On systems where make (or gmake) can support parallel builds, it is safe
to invoke the parallel build options to build the library and the
executables, for example,

gmake -j 3 all

Since it take a while (~ 20 min with GCC and ~ 2 min with clang) to
build the libraries, it is a good idea to spawn multiple jobs to compile
them.  However, it is NOT safe to run the tests in parallel because
different jobs will attempt to write the same files.  The commands 'make
check', 'make more-check', and 'make full-check' must be run as serial
jobs (with only one thread of execution).

If you are compiling with GCC, please choose version 4.8 for better
support of the extensive template use.  For clang compiler suite, use
version 3.5 or later.

To place the executable files and libraries in their expected locations,
execute 'make install'.  As usual, the location of the installed files
is specified by the variable 'prefix', e.g., (it is usually better to
specify installation direcotry on the command line of configure, see
note 13 )

make prefix=${HOME} install

which will put the executables in ${HOME}/bin and libraries in
${HOME}/lib.  Prior to installation, the executables and libraries are
located in various hidden directories selected by libtools.  For
example, libfastbit.a is usually located in src/.libs and the
executables in examples are in examples/.libs.


----------
Configuration Options

Run './configure --help' to review all options available.  The majority
of the options are standard options available to all GNU build tools.
There are only a few additional options
  --enable-debug [debugging option]
  --enable-xopt  [extra optimization option]

The default for the 1st option is left to the configure script itself,
which in absence of any direction will normally enable the debug option.
The default for the 2nd option is "no", in which case, the flag present
in CXXFLAGS or the default determined by the configure script will be
used.  With --enable-xopt, the optimization flag -O5 will be used if the
compiler accepts it otherwise -O3 will be append to the list of compiler
options.  The option -O5 is generally supported by GCC compilers and can
slightly improve the performance of some query operations, but may also
introduce errors due to excessive compiler "optimization."  In most
cases, we suggest users to leave both of these options as their default
values.

If CXXFLAGS is specified on the command line of configure or is present
as an evironment variable, the configure script will not add its usual
default options, which is typically "-g -O2".  If CXXFLAGS is specified,
it should include desired optimization flags.

The configure script will attempt to detect whether a JDK is available
when it is run, however, the detection mechanism primarily rely on the
presence of environment variable JAVA_HOME.  If this variable is not
defined or you want to use a different JDK, you may use the following
option of the configure script to explicitly specify the path of JDK,

  --with-java=full-path-to-jdk

On MS Windows with visual studio, the path to JDK must be explicitly
speicified in the visual studio for the java project.  Here are some
steps to take

(1) open the windows explorer, navigate to win directory in your FastBit
    directory, double click on ibis.sln should invoke visual studio if
    your machine have visual studio,

(2) the solution includes 7 projects, right click on the java project,
    select properties from the menu,

(3) then select C++ from the list of Configuration Properties for the
    project, modify the "Additional Include Directories" field to
    include the JDK directory on your machine

To make sure the Java Native Interface is not compiled, use the option

  --without-java


NOTE: FastBit requires pthread support, on a MinGW installation, be sure
      install pthread library.  On MS Windows, install some pthread
      win32 <http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/>.  Users need to
      specify the directory containing the header files and the library
      files using similar procedure.  The "Additional Libary
      Directories" that need to be modified is under "Linker" in the
      list of Configuration Properties.

NOTE: The Makefiles in directory contrib are updated with the configure
      script, but they are not built as part of normal make command.
      One needs to go into each subdirectory of contrib and execute the
      make command there.


----------
Compiler Macros

There are a number of compiler macros for controlling certain internal
FastBit parameters.  When you find unexpected troubles with FastBit,
they might come in handy.  Here is a list in the order of potential
usefulness.

WITHOUT_FASTBIT_CONFIG_H

  This macro must be defined if the system can not run the configure
  script in the main directory.  The configure script produces the file
  src/fastbit-config.h that contains macros about the specific compiler
  and machine setup.  When WITHOUT_FASTBIT_CONFIG_H is defined, the
  source code will not attempt to include src/fastbit-config.h.  The
  macros defined in it will take on default values.  This option has
  been mainly tested on MS Windows platform with VisualStudio.  For
  convenience, we have made sure this macro is not necessary under the
  specific environment of MS windows with VisualStudio, all other
  platforms that can not run the configure script, must define this
  macro!

FASTBIT_MAX_WAIT_TIME

  Defines the amount of time (in seconds) the file manager shall wait
  before giving up on its attempt to acquire the desired amount of
  memory.  Presumably, while waiting, other tasks would have finished
  and released the memory being used.  The default time is 600 seconds
  in normal operations and 5 seconds if DEBUG is defined.

FASTBIT_MIN_MAP_SIZE

  FastBit will attempt to use memory map to read large data files if
  mmap and its associated functions are available.  This defines the
  minimal file size (in bytes) before it will attempt to use mmap.

DEBUG

  Turning on DEBUG will enable FastBit to print a lot of diagnostic
  messages about its internal operations.  It is useful for debugging
  FastBit internal operations.

WAH_CHECK_SIZE

  Instruct WAH compression functions to check the size of the bitmaps
  when they are constructed.  This may be useful if one suspects that
  the WAH compressed bitmap are not what they supposed to be.  This
  option was used by the developers for debugging.  If you encounter any
  problem that require this option to fix, please report such cases to
  fastbit-users@hpcrdm.lbl.gov.

FASTBIT_READ_BITVECTOR0

  In earlier (pre-release) versions of FastBit, it always reads the
  first bitmap of every bitmap index regardless of whether it is
  actually used.  Because of this legacy, it is possible there are
  functions that still rely on this old behavior.  If you encounter
  certain unexpected problems, turning this option "on" may resolve
  them.  Please report such cases to fastbit-users@hpcrdm.lbl.gov.

FASTBIT_EXPAND_ALL_TYPES

  The macro FASTBIT_EXPAND_ALL_TYPES controls whether all ten different
  columns will have its own template instance function.  By default,
  with FASTBIT_EXPAND_ALL_TYPES not defined, only five instances are
  generated.  The columns of type BYTE and SHORT are converted to INT
  and passed to the function that handles INT.  The columns of type
  UBYTE and USHORT are converted to UINT.  Similarly, the type ULONG is
  converted LONG and handled as LONG.  The first two convertions may
  only increase run time, but will not affect the correctness of the
  program.  However, the last conversion may cause correctness issues if
  the unsigned 64-bit integers actually have the sign bit set to 1,
  i.e., > 2^63 (= 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 ~ 9x10^18).

FASTBIT_SYNC_WRITE

  If this macro is defined, FastBit will attempt to make sure the files
  opened for write operations synchronize its in-memory content with
  on-disk content before closing the files.  This reduces the likelihood
  of data corruption in case of program crash, but it also makes the
  program waits for disk operations to complete.  The delay can be
  especially painful if there are numerous write operaitons.

FASTBIT_USE_LONG_OFFSETS

  For FastBit to write index files with 64-bit bitmap offsets.  Without
  defining this compiler macro, FastBit will only use 64-bit offsets if
  the index size is expected to be larger than 2GB.  This macro only
  affects the writing function, the reading function will always check
  the header to determine the expected bitmap offset size.


----------
Known Issues

    If you have encountered an issue with FastBit code, this list of
    known issues might be of help.  In addition, you might check out the
    mailing list archive at
    <https://hpcrdm.lbl.gov/pipermail/fastbit-users/> to see if the
    issue has already been addressed.  The mail messages are searchable
    through the search boxes on any of the FastBit web pages.  Of course
    mailing your question to <fastbit-users@hpcrdm.lbl.gov> is always an
    option.

    Before you spend any time figuring out a problem, it might be
    helpful to check whether the problem still exists with the current
    source code.  A nightly snapshot of the SVN repository for the code
    is available for download at
    <https://codeforge.lbl.gov/snapshots.php?group_id=44>.  The snapshot
    is built daily between 2 and 3 AM Pacific Time zone (USA).

(1) Many compilers will issue lots of warnings about potential loss of
    data in various assignments, for example, trying to assign a 32-bit
    integer to a 32-bit floating-point number (type float).  In some
    cases, we have tried to prevent such conversions, but in many cases
    we have left this option open to the users, for example, it is
    possible for a user to retrieve the values of a 32-bit integer
    column as floats by calling ibis::table::getColumnAsFloats.  Callers
    should be aware that such conversion may lose precision.  This type
    of conversion may also occur when comparing two types of columns
    directly (without indexes), for example if a where clause contains "A
    < B" and A is a signed integer but B is a unsigned integer.  Users
    should be aware of such problems.

(2) Under cygwin, some times, the read-write lock may print out warning
    messages, but the operations seem to carry on without any problem.
    We have not tried to figure out what are the causes of these
    problems, if you have information about them or know how to fix the
    problems, we would like to hear about them.  Email your suggestions
    to <fastbit-users@hpcrdm.lbl.gov>.

(3) The tests in 'make check' do a very minimal amount of testing.  To
    perform more through testing, use 'make more-check' or 'make
    full-check'.  The tests in 'make more-check' may take ~ 15 min,
    while 'make full-check' may make take several hours.  These longer
    tests write a large number of files into the test directory, which
    defaults to tests/tmp.  It is a good idea to use a local file
    system instead of a remotely mounted file system for test directory.
    To change the test directory use variable TESTDIR, e.g.,

    make TESTDIR=/tmp/kwu/tests full-check

    which will use /tmp/kwu/tests as the test directory.

    Running tests under cygwin takes much longer than on a linux
    machine.  If you have any suggestions on improving this setup,
    please email <fastbit-users@hpcrdm.lbl.gov>.

(4) The tests in 'check-marksdb' involves a long series of arithmetic
    operations.  Depending on the implementation of math library, a
    slightly different d values may be outputted causing the tests to
    fail.  Please examine the differences between file marksdb-[1234]
    against the ones in directory tests.  If the values differ only in
    the last one or two digits, then the tests run fine.  However, if
    they are different beyond the last two digits, please report the
    problem to <fastbit-users@hpcrdm.lbl.gov>.

(5) Due to extensive uses of C++11 features (such as unordered_map and
    unique_ptr), the current release of FastBit can only be compiled
    with GCC 4.8 or clang 3.5

(6) Certain machines with a large mount of memory actually limits the
    amount of memory each process may use.  In such cases, the default
    cache size of half of the physical memory size may be over the limit
    of the memory allowed by the OS.  It is important to coordinate
    these two limits.  More specifically, the memory used by FastBit
    memory cache should be less than the OS limit, otherwise, FastBit
    program may crash due to memory allocation problems.  For example,
    on jacquard.nersc.gov, the maximum virtual memory allowed per
    process is 2GB for certain class of interactive jobs, but there are
    6GB of physical memory.  By default, FastBit will attempt to use 3GB
    of memory, which is over the OS assigned memory limit.  In this
    case, adding an RC file with something like
    "fileManager.maxBytes=1.8GB" will reduce the memory allowed to
    FastBit and avoid memory usage problem.

(7) Certain linux clusters do not support shared libraries on compute
    nodes, even though shared libraries are supported on the front end.
    In such a case, the configure script will detect shared libraries as
    supported.  Use option --disable-shared to prevent it from trying to
    build the shared library.  For example, Cray XT systems (e.g., XT4
    franklin.nersc.gov and XT5 hopper.nersc.gov) do not support shared
    libraries on the compute nodes.  In fact on a Cray XT5 system,
    it is not able to produce a .so file.

(8) FastBit makes extensive use of STL objects, this causes a problem
    when one wants to build a DLL on a windows machine.  There is at
    least on success story of using STLport to replace the STL from
    visual studio and build DLL successfully, see
    <https://hpcrdm.lbl.gov/pipermail/fastbit-users/2008-June/000127.html>.

(9) The test 12 of check-ibis fails when the PGI compiler is used to
    compile the code.  It encounters a segmentation violation some times
    inside a string construtor and some times in the constructor of
    string stream object.  We would guess that the PGI compiler might
    not be producinga thread-safe operator new.  If you have any clue as
    what is really going on or how to get around the problem, please
    send your suggestions or corrections to
    <fastbit-users@hpcrdm.lbl.gov>.

(10) If the configure script finds a working version of javac, but fails
     to find a working version of java, it is likely that CLASSPATH is
     not set correctly.  One common problem on a unix/linux machine is
     that the current directory is not in CLASSPATH.  One way to fix
     such a problem is to prepend the dot in front of CLASSPATH,
     e.g. (in boune shell)

     CLASSPATH=.:$CLASSPATH

(11) If you encounter a "libtool: Version mismatch error," you should be
     able to overwrite the file libtool with a copy from your current
     system, e.g., /usr/bin/libtool.  Alternatively, run the following
     commands before trying to run configure script again

     aclocal && automake && autoconf

(12) The header file FlexLexer.h in /usr/include directory could be too
     old to work with the files selectLexer.cc and whereLexer.cc.  This
     will cause a compiler error of some sort.  Here is an example:

whereLexer.cc: In member function 'virtual ibis::whereParser::token::yytokentype ibis::whereLexer::lex(ibis::whereParser::semantic_type*, ibis::location*)':
whereLexer.cc:1244: error: 'yywrap' was not declared in this scope

     In this case, explicitly add '-I ${PWD}/win' to CXXFLAGS can force
     the FlexLexer.h in directory win to be included, e.g.,

     make -j 4 CXXFLAGS="-O3 -I ${PWD}/win" all

(13) If you build FastBit Java native interface, make sure --prefix is
     specified at configure command line, otherwise "make install" may
     complain about libfastbitjni.lo can not be installed in any
     directory other than /usr/local/lib (if you have specified --prefix
     but wanted to install in a different directory, you might see a
     similar message).  The automatic build script apparently remembers
     the path generated by configure script and does not know how to
     make use of the prefix specified on the command line of make.

(14) The configure script should not need root privillege to run.  In
     fact, running it with sudo can causes permission problems with some
     temporary files and therefore cause the configure script to fail.
     The only command that may need root privillege would be the 'make
     install' command if the files are to be installed in a privilleged
     directory such as /usr or /usr/local.

(15) Compile on windows under various versions of visual studio
     encounters the following error message:
     ...VC\INCLUDE\stdint.h(18): error C2632: 'short' followed by 'short' is illegal
     This reference to stdint.h is caused by the inclusion of STL
     header file "vector".  In the code we can control, we have avoided
     referring to stdint.h, but we have to use vector and is not sure
     how to tell vector not to include stdint.h.  If you know a way to
     deal with this, please let us know.

(16) the make command on MinGW32 does not appear to function properly in
     multithread mode; the command 'make -j 2' will be stuck after
     compiling the first two files.
