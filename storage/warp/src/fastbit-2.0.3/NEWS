-- refine the code in templates ibis::part::doScan and
   ibis::part::doCount to reduce the amount of computations
-- add macro WITHOUT_FASTBIT_CONFIG_H as the opposite of HAVE_CONFIG_H
   so that the user code does not need to define HAVE_CONFIG_H when
   configure script can be run (this change assumes the FastBit
   config.h file is present and removes the need for client code to 
   define HAVE_CONFIG_H when including FastBit headers, a problem first
   encountered by Hank Childs)
-- integrate part::testRangeOperators as part of selfTest to exercise
   all combinations of logical operators in a range expression
-- clean up ibin.cpp, irange.cpp, imesa.cpp, icentre.cpp, ixambit.cpp,

   gcc 4.0.1)

Wed Apr 15 16:42:04 PDT 2009
Version ibis1.0.7
-- fix a bug in ibis::qExpr::simplfy that returns a deleted query
   expression (a bug reported by Hank Childs and Prabhat)

   fixed-sized values
-- make it possible to use aliases defined in select clause inside where
   clauses (to address a case raised by David Marks)

Fri Feb  6 12:00:26 PST 2009
Version ibis1.0.4
-- add example program rara.cpp as a minimalistic client code

   string-valued column (to address a request from Andrey Kolchanov)
-- split src/parth3d.cpp into three files (one for each function that
   requires massive number of instances of template function) and limit
   the number of template instances.  The is to reduce the compilation
   time under gcc.  The full slew of instances can still be generated if
   the macro FASTBIT_EXPAND_ALL_TYPES is defined.
-- update the parser to accept functions with a single number as the
   argument (a bug reported by David Marks)
-- add calls to free up memory after encountering failure to retrieve
   file content (to address a problem encountered by Alessandro Capucci)

Tue Jan 20 21:14:57 PST 2009
Version ibis1.0.3
-- add ibis::text::selectLongs to return the starting positions of the
   string valued columns (to enable reading of strings for java
   based applications, a hack in response to Andrey Kolchanov's
   question)
-- implement ibis::util::sharedInt32 and ibis::util::sharedInt64 using
   GCC's atomic operations and Visual Studio's atomic operations.  This
   should improve the speed of operations and make reference  counting
   and tracking of memory usage more reliable on multi-threaded
   applications
-- add more test cases to ibis::part::selfTests to exercise query
   evluation function in multi-thread mode
-- add another set of binning functions, get1DBins, get2DBins, and
   get3DBins that return std::vector<ibis::bitvector*>.  These functions
   will return null pointers for empty bins, which can reduce memory
   usage and execution time in cases there are many empty bins

Mon Jan  5 12:32:07 PST 2009
Version ibis1.0.2
-- add another set of binning functions, get1DBins, get2DBins, and
   get3DBins, that take (begin, end, stride) to specify the bin
   boundaries instead choosing bin boundaries by the functions
   themselves.  A feature requested by Oliver and Probhat.
-- use the new version of binning functions to debug the existing
   versions
-- reduce the memory usage of the two versions of ibis::util::intersect
   by explicitly compressing the results and copying the compressed ones
-- make sure a bitvector has its own storage when it is being modified

Version b0.9.8
-- add arithmetic expression to the select clauses accepted by function
   ibis::table::select
-- update java example (correct issues raised by Niklas Bulitta)
-- rewrite the parser for query expressions to use the C++ options of
   bison and flex (predicate* changed to where*)

   expressions under namespace ibis::math
-- address an error report by David Kantowitz about
   ibis::column::getString
-- minor changes to print statement and code organizations

Fri Sep 19 22:38:43 PDT 2008
Version b0.9.7

-- increase the cap on the number of bins in adaptive2DBins to make sure
   Prabhat's tests run without surprises

Thu Aug 21 09:58:44 PDT 2008
Version b0.9.6
-- implement new adaptive binning functions for computing histograms of
   1D and 2D that avoids binary searches.  The new functions are not
   only faster, but because they use more fine bins internally the
   output bins are closer to be equal-weight than before
-- change the mensa::cursor class to read data one block at a time so
   that ardea.cpp can print a few row of a large table without running
   out of memory
-- clean up the constructor of qDiscreteRange to eliminate duplicates
   correctly (an error reported by Prabhat)

   Matthias Vallentin)
-- fix bug in ibis::part::writeTDC related to column shape statement
   (reported by Xufei Qian)
-- update testing code to match the change of option -j to -y for
   ibis.cpp (-j is now for join)

Wed May 28 07:38:11 PDT 2008
Version b0.9.3
-- update the range-equality encoding (ibis::bylt and ibis::pack) and
   interval-equality encoding (ibis::fuge and ibis::fuzz) to use the new
   default values for the numbers of coarse bins based on the neutral
   space-time trade-off heuristics
-- add option -f to examples/thula.cpp (requested by Jon Strabala)
-- change ibis::util::userName to primarily use getpwuid (instead of
   getlogin) following the suggestion of Ross Bates

   data
-- add assignment of nrows in ibis::bin::construct that takes an array
   as input, a problem found by Prabhat
-- correct html errors in indexSpec.html
-- update decisions in column::selectValues to use the function read
   when it anticipate that a small number of seeks will be needed.  This
   should improve the speed of reading a small number of records.
-- add an optional argument to unconditional version of
   get2DDistribution to allow the caller to choose whether to use
   indexes or data (requested by Prabhat)
-- update test cases 7 and 8 of check-ibis to make them more robust
-- add ibis::util::timer class

   categorical values (key), add test cases to check for this error in
   'make check' and 'make quick-check'
-- fix bugs in histograming function ibis::part::count2DBins and
   count3DBins, update the related documentation (bugs reported by Prabhat)
-- in reponse to a question from Devin McNamara, modified readCSV to
   allow arbitrary user-specified delimiters
-- add a set of tests cases that works with very limited memory allowed
   for file manager (invoked through 'make full-check'; inspired by
   Jochen Schlosser).  This has revealed a number of serious problems as
   follows:
-- add ibis::column::softWriteLock to prevent deadlock during tight
   memory situations,
-- add checks for nil pointer of idx before using it,
-- add function in array_t to tell users that it is attached to a file
   or in-memory, this is needed so that ibis::bitvector::compress can
   avoid modifying the ones in files (modifying such bitvector causes
   segmentation faults)
-- add destructors to ibis::bak::grain and ibis::bak2::grain.  If the
   constructor of ibis::bak or ibis::bak2 fails, previous
   implementation of grain do not automatically release the bitvectors
   allocated
-- replace function ibis::util::getBuffer with class ibis::util::buffer
   to ensure the memory allocated is always freed

Wed Feb 20 11:26:11 PST 2008
Version b0.8.4
-- replace ibis::part::doCompare and friends with templated functions
-- add checks for the values returned by lseek and other I/O functions
   to fix a segmentation fault observed by Jochen Schlosser of
   University of Hamburg
-- fix bugs in histogramming functions found by Prabhat: unchecked
   pointers returned by selectInts and friends, uncheck empty arrays,
   swapped string arguments
-- add test cases for checking the histogramming functions in directory
   tests
-- add target check-all to the top-level makefile
-- separate the index generation from their uses in tests (as part of
   check-all) to exercise the index reconstruction functions, fix bug
   revealed by this separation (ibis::fade and ibis::bin)

Wed Feb  6 09:47:21 PST 2008
Version b0.8.3
-- fix a number of bugs reported by Jochen Schlosser of University of
   Hamburg: (1) seg fault due to minimum actually being negative even
   though the metadata indicate it is to be zero or positive, (2) when
   index ibis::direkte is used to answer a query, it erroneously casts
   negative integers numbers to unsigned values and produces incorrect
   answers
-- fix performance a problem reported by Prabhat: a long list in the
   form of "A in (...)" is translated into a massive set of equality
   conditions joined with OR.  Evaluate such a query condition as
   qDiscreteRange.
-- fix bugs in assigning bin boundaries for log-scaled bin on integer
   values and low cardinality columns

Wed Jan 16 12:37:24 PST 2008
Version b0.8.2

   Hamburg: ibis::column::evaluateRange calls ibis::part::doScan
   unnecessarily, a number of functions in ibis::fileManager::storage
   class does not check for nil pointers before using them, ibis::part
   has a number of funtions that neglected to free memory returned by
   ibis::column::dataFileName
-- change exception handler to not remove index files unless the index
   files are really at fault
-- add return values to query evaluation function so that a negative
   number will be returned if it fails for any reason, previous version
   neglects to return the error condition to the user

Sun Dec 23 19:33:34 PST 2007
Version b0.8.1
-- add win/MinGW.mak for compiling code under MinGW/MSYS
-- fix ibis::util::makeDir problem with execute bit in directory permission

   managed by FastBit
-- add functions to JNI interface for input of data records
-- fix a bug in ibis::tafel::write that leaves tdesc nil

Thu Oct 18 18:53:45 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.8
-- add Jave Native Interface for some querying functions and a test program
-- fix errors found on an intel-base Mac
-- fix errors in the ardea.cpp (when run without any arguments)
-- removed -DDEBUG from configuration option --enable-debug

Tue Oct  9 16:52:55 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.7 includes a couple of bug fixes and some minor clean up
-- incorporates a bug fix from Matthias Vallentin to correct a wrong
   function call in ibis::part::reactivate (src/parti.cpp:1261)
-- add test cases for ibis::part::reactivate in ibis.cpp and
   tests/Makefile.am
-- add checks for array_t::m_begin to ensure it is valid before use
-- renamed all functions named dataTable() to partition() to match the
   name of the classes involved

Sun Oct  7 17:21:16 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.6 introduces a new logging mechanism
-- the new class ibis::util::logger is introduced to allow the error
   message to be redirected to a file.  To specify the name for this
   file, use either the function ibis::util::getLofFile or specify
   logfile in a RC file.

Mon Sep 17 17:09:48 PDT 2007
Version a0.7.5 introduces two new features.
-- allow out-dated indexes to be used during query processing.  Since
   the time needed to full update the indexes are typically longer than
   the time need to answer the queries using the raw data, this option
   improves the query response time for the queries that come right
   after the arrival of new rows.
-- allow for rows to be marked as inactive in a data partition.  These
   inactive rows may eventually be re-activated or permenantly purged
   from a data partition.

Fri Jul 27 21:53:57 PDT 2007
-- First public release, version a0.7.
