* WARNING: Due to the uses of C++11 and C99 features, as of late 2014, *
* FastBit code can only be compiled on MS Windows under CygWin or      *

This directory contains a makefile (Win.mak) and a set of project files
for building the library and the examples.  They require Visual Studio
.NET or later as well as a version of pthreads-win32.  You have to edit
these files to point to the correct locations of the compiler and the
pthreads-win32 library!

Pthreads-win32 is available for download (under LGPL, for free) from
http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/

NOTE: Visual Studio may produce a large number of warnings, most of
which are harmless as far as we know.  However, if you do notice
something of consequence, please report them to
<fastbit-users@hpcrdm.lbl.gov>.

NOTE: Win.mak works with nmake that comes with Visual Studio.  Invoke it
with command line such as

nmake -f Win.mak all

NOTE: On a multi-core machine, VisualStudio 2008 will try to build
multiple projects at the same time without checking whether there are
potential dependencies!  This can cause a lot of problems because most
of the existing projects share the same set of intermediate files.  The
best course of action is to build one project at a time when using
VisualStudio.  Alternatively, use 'nmake -f Win.mak' which builds the
executables sequentially.

It is possible to build a DLL library that exports ibis::part and
ibis::query interface as well as the C API of Fastbit.
To use the nmake system directly, one may build the DLL library and the
test program tcapi.exe with the following commands (on one line)

nmake -f Win.mak clean && nmake -f Win.mak dll && nmake -f win.mak trydll

The test program trydll.cpp is a modified version of
..\examples\ibis.cpp with troublesome functions removed.  It maintains
the key functionality of ibis.cpp, which exercises the ibis::part and
ibis::query functions.

The test program tcapi.c exercises the C API of FastBit.  Please refere
the source code ..\examples\tcapi.c for usage of tcapi.exe.

Here is a set of commands to try, assuming that you've built tcapi.exe
and trydll.exe in this directory.

# generate a sample data with 100 rows and 3 columns named a, b, and c
tcapi.exe -v
# the following two commands should produce the same number of hits
tcapi.exe tmp "a=0"
trydll.exe -d tmp -q "where a=0"
# the following two commands should print same values for column c
tcapi.exe tmp "a < 10" c f
trydll.exe -d tmp -q "select c where a < 10"


To compile under MinGW/MSYS with dll use the following command
make -f MinGW.mak pthreads-w32 dll trydll tcapi

NOTE: In case examples/ibis.cpp fails to compile, try win/trydll.cpp
instead.

Known problem with DLL under MS windows (either Visual studio or MinGW/MSYS)

As of Dec. 22, 2007, the biggest problem seems to be the use of
ibis::bitvector in a client code.  Somehow pointers to
ibis::bitvector (created by the DLL) are fine, but a locally declared
ibis::bitvector object has problems of creating the underlying support
object array_t<uint32_t> (compiler may complain about array_t<unsigned
long int> instead).  If you are a familiar with such type of problem,
please email your suggestion to <fastbit-users@hpcrdm.lbl.gov>.

NOTE: Due to extensive uses of std::map and other STL classes in class
      hierarchy ibis::table, they are not suitable for DLL exporting
      <http://support.microsoft.com/kb/168958>.  The ibis::part and
      ibis::query interface and the C API seem to work fine.

NOTE: The test suite in ../tests rely on too many features that are only
      available on Unix type of machines and can not be run on MS
      Windows.

Sept. 27, 2008 On some windows machines, under visual studio, the
compilation fails once in a while for not being able to write certain
files.  Usually rebuild a second time fix the problem -- not sure where
is the real problem.

Oct. 1, 2008 added FlexLexer.h so that the new version of parser code
can compile under MS windows systems

Nov. 11, 2008: If your version of VisualStudio complains about the
version of the project files being too new or too old, you should be
able to open those files in a text editor and change the version numbers
to those of your VisualStudio installation.  The few times I have tried
this, they all worked out fine.  If you have a better solution to this
little problem, please email yours to <fastbit-users@hpcrdm.lbl.gov>.

Jan. 28, 2009: Since verion 1.0.2, FastBit attempts to use atomic
operation InterlockedExchangeAdd64 and friends to update the counters
such as the total memory usage.  However, some of these functions are
only available on Windows Vista.  One recommended detection of Vista is
based on a macro called WINVER (or NTDDI_VERSION).  However, Visual
Studio does not seem to define WINVER or NTDDI_VERSION, at least on my
test machines.  If you encounter any indication that
InterlockedExchangeAdd64 is not available, at run time, linking time or
compile time, you might add /D "WINVER=0x0501" to the compiler options.
The following web page has more information about WINVER
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383745(VS.85).aspx>

May 5, 2009: Users may explicitly define the macro
WITHOUT_FASTBIT_CONFIG_H to inform the compiler to not include
../src/config.h.  On systems that could not run ../configure, the file
../src/configure either does not existing or was created for another
system.  In this case, one need to defined WITHOUT_FASTBIT_CONFIG_H if
not using VisualStudio compilers.

Dec 13, 2009: complaints about 'LPCWSTR'
The FastBit source code is developed without considering multi-byte
character sets nor unicode character set.  As such, the "Character Set"
field in General tab of "Configuration Properties" of you visual studio
project must be "Not Set", i.e., can be neither "multi-byte character
set" nor "Unicode".  If you create a new visual studio project with a
newer version of visual studio, the default character set might be
unicode.  Be sure to change it to "Not Set."

Jan 17, 2012: MinGW-w64 can downloaded from
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/>
This site also have the necessary 64-bit pthread implementation needed
for compiling FastBit

Mar 5, 2012: renamed Dominique's MinGW.mak to xMinGW.mak
xMinGW.mak is meant for cross compiling on ubuntu to produce MS Windows binary
