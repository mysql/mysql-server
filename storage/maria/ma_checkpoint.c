  Summary:
  checkpoints are done either by a background thread (checkpoint every Nth

  In ha_maria, it's not made available to clients, and will soon be done by a
  background thread (periodically taking checkpoints and flushing dirty

      PageCacheFlushConcurrencyBugs
      Inside the page cache, calls to flush_pagecache_blocks_int() on the same
      file are serialized. Examples of concurrency bugs which happened when we
      didn't have this serialization:
      - maria_chk_size() (via CHECK TABLE) happens concurrently with
      Checkpoint: Checkpoint is flushing a page: it pins the page and is
      pre-empted, maria_chk_size() wants to flush this page too so gets an
      error because Checkpoint pinned this page. Such error makes
      maria_chk_size() mark the table as corrupted.
      - maria_close() happens concurrently with Checkpoint:
      Checkpoint is flushing a page: it registers a request on the page, is
      pre-empted ; maria_close() flushes this page too with FLUSH_RELEASE:
      FLUSH_RELEASE will cause a free_block() which assumes the page is in the
      LRU, but it is not (as Checkpoint registered a request). Crash.
      - one thread is evicting a page of the file out of the LRU: it marks it
      iPC_BLOCK_IN_SWITCH and is pre-empted. Then two other threads do flushes
      of the same file concurrently (like above). Then one flusher sees the
      page is in switch, removes it from changed_blocks[] and puts it in its
      first_in_switch, so the other flusher will not see the page at all and
      return too early. If it's maria_close() which returns too early, then
      maria_close() may close the file descriptor, and the other flusher, and
      the evicter will fail to write their page: corruption.
