/*
  Assign pages of the index file for a table to a key cache

  SYNOPSIS
    maria_assign_to_pagecache()
      info          open table
      key_map       map of indexes to assign to the key cache
      pagecache_ptr pointer to the key cache handle
      assign_lock   Mutex to lock during assignment

  PREREQUESTS
    One must have a READ lock or a WRITE lock on the table when calling
    the function to ensure that there is no other writers to it.

    The caller must also ensure that one doesn't call this function from
    two different threads with the same table.

  NOTES
    At present pages for all indexes must be assigned to the same key cache.
    In future only pages for indexes specified in the key_map parameter
    of the table will be assigned to the specified key cache.

  RETURN VALUE
    0  If a success
    #  Error code

/*
  Change all MARIA entries that uses one key cache to another key cache

  SYNOPSIS
    maria_change_pagecache()
    old_pagecache	Old key cache
    new_pagecache	New key cache

  NOTES
    This is used when we delete one key cache.

    To handle the case where some other threads tries to open an MARIA
    table associated with the to-be-deleted key cache while this operation
    is running, we have to call 'multi_pagecache_change()' from this
    function while we have a lock on the MARIA table list structure.

    This is safe as long as it's only MARIA that is using this specific
    key cache.
