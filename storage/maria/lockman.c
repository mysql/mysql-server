/*
  Generic Lock Manager

  Lock manager handles locks on "resources", a resource must be uniquely
  identified by a 64-bit number. Lock manager itself does not imply
  anything about the nature of a resource - it can be a row, a table, a
  database, or just anything.

  Locks belong to "lock owners". A Lock owner is uniquely identified by a
  16-bit number. A function loid2lo must be provided by the application
  that takes such a number as an argument and returns a LOCK_OWNER
  structure.

  Lock levels are completely defined by three tables. Lock compatibility
  matrix specifies which locks can be held at the same time on a resource.
  Lock combining matrix specifies what lock level has the same behaviour as
  a pair of two locks of given levels. getlock_result matrix simplifies
  intention locking and lock escalation for an application, basically it
  defines which locks are intention locks and which locks are "loose"
  locks.  It is only used to provide better diagnostics for the
  application, lock manager itself does not differentiate between normal,
  intention, and loose locks.

  Internally lock manager is based on a lock-free hash, see lf_hash.c for
  details.  All locks are stored in a hash, with a resource id as a search
  key, so all locks for the same resource will be considered collisions and
  will be put in a one (lock-free) linked list.  The main lock-handling
  logic is in the inner loop that searches for a lock in such a linked
  list - lockfind().

  This works as follows. Locks generally are added to the end of the list
  (with one exception, see below). When scanning the list it is always
  possible to determine what locks are granted (active) and what locks are
  waiting - first lock is obviously active, the second is active if it's
  compatible with the first, and so on, a lock is active if it's compatible
  with all previous locks and all locks before it are also active.
  To calculate the "compatible with all previous locks" all locks are
  accumulated in prev_lock variable using lock_combining_matrix.

  Lock upgrades: when a thread that has a lock on a given resource,
  requests a new lock on the same resource and the old lock is not enough
  to satisfy new lock requirements (which is defined by
  lock_combining_matrix[old_lock][new_lock] != old_lock), a new lock is
  placed in the list. Depending on other locks it is immediately active or
  it will wait for other locks. Here's an exception to "locks are added
  to the end" rule - upgraded locks are added after the last active lock
  but before all waiting locks. Old lock (the one we upgraded from) is
  not removed from the list, indeed it may be needed if the new lock was
  in a savepoint that gets rolled back. So old lock is marked as "ignored"
  (IGNORE_ME flag). New lock gets an UPGRADED flag.

  Loose locks add an important exception to the above. Loose locks do not
  always commute with other locks. In the list IX-LS both locks are active,
  while in the LS-IX list only the first lock is active. This creates a
  problem in lock upgrades. If the list was IX-LS and the owner of the
  first lock wants to place LS lock (which can be immediately granted), the
  IX lock is upgraded to LSIX and the list becomes IX-LS-LSIX, which,
  according to the lock compatibility matrix means that the last lock is
  waiting - of course it all happened because IX and LS were swapped and
  they don't commute. To work around this there's ACTIVE flag which is set
  in every lock that never waited (was placed active), and this flag
  overrides "compatible with all previous locks" rule.

  When a lock is placed to the end of the list it's either compatible with
  all locks and all locks are active - new lock becomes active at once, or
  it conflicts with some of the locks, in this case in the 'blocker'
  variable a conflicting lock is returned and the calling thread waits on a
  pthread condition in the LOCK_OWNER structure of the owner of the
  conflicting lock. Or a new lock is compatible with all locks, but some
  existing locks are not compatible with each other (example: request IS,
  when the list is S-IX) - that is not all locks are active. In this case a
  first waiting lock is returned in the 'blocker' variable, lockman_getlock()
  notices that a "blocker" does not conflict with the requested lock, and
  "dereferences" it, to find the lock that it's waiting on.  The calling
  thread than begins to wait on the same lock.

  To better support table-row relations where one needs to lock the table
  with an intention lock before locking the row, extended diagnostics is
  provided.  When an intention lock (presumably on a table) is granted,
  lockman_getlock() returns one of GOT_THE_LOCK (no need to lock the row,
  perhaps the thread already has a normal lock on this table),
  GOT_THE_LOCK_NEED_TO_LOCK_A_SUBRESOURCE (need to lock the row, as usual),
  GOT_THE_LOCK_NEED_TO_INSTANT_LOCK_A_SUBRESOURCE (only need to check
  whether it's possible to lock the row, but no need to lock it - perhaps
  the thread has a loose lock on this table). This is defined by
  getlock_result[] table.
