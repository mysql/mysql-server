#
# Note: The s_winmsi script in Berkeley DB core closely parallels the
# s_winmsi script in Berkeley DB/XML.  If you change one,
# consider whether your changes apply to the other.
# As of this writing, the two s_winmsi scripts 'diff' very closely, and
# identical portions have been factored into functions in s_winmsi.fcn.
#
#   Usage: s_winmsi [ options ]
#
# See the Usage() function in s_winmsi.fcn for a full list of options.
# By default, this script expects a db-X.Y.Z.NC.zip file
# to be in this directory, and uses it to build all binaries
# needed for an Windows install, and finally builds the an
# output db-X.Y.Z.NC.msi file that can be installed on
# Windows XP and 2000.
#
# The major other inputs to this script are these files:
#
#   features.in        list of choosable features (like Java,PHP,...)
#   files.in           what files are in each feature and where they belong
#   links.in           a list of URLs that end up as part of the Start Menu
#   environment.in     a list of environment vars that must be set
#
# This script does a number of operations, using the directory
# './winmsi/stage' as a staging area:
#
#   extracts the contents of the input ZIP file and uses those
#   files (minus docs/...) to build a Sources directory for
#   the Sources features.
#
#   builds Berkeley DB using Visual Studio tools using a .BAT
#   script derived from winbuild.in .
#
#   builds Perl and other APIs .
#
#   uses {features,files,links,environment}.in to build some include
#   files in WiX XML format.  These files are named
#   *.wixinc (e.g. directory.wixinc)
#
#   run m4 on dbcorewix.in to create dbcore.wxs .  dbcorewix.in
#   uses m4 macros to allow reasonable refactoring of repeated
#   UI code.  Also, m4 is used to include the files created in
#   the previous step.
#
#   Use the WiX compiler/linker on the .wxs files to create the .msi file.
