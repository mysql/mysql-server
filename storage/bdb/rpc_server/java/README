Berkeley DB Java RPC server.

The Java implementation of the Berkeley DB RPC server is intended
primarily for testing purposes.  It provides the same interface
as the C and C++ RPC servers, but is implemented via the Java API
rather than the C or C++ APIs.  This allows the existing Tcl test
suite to exercise the Java API without modification.

The Java RPC server relies on a Java version of rpcgen to
automatically generate appropriate Java classes from the RPC
interface specification (../db_server.x).  We use jrpcgen, which
is part of the Remote Tea for Java project:
  acplt.plt.rwth-aachen.de/ks/english/remotetea.html

To rebuild the Java stubs from db_server.x, you will need to
download the full Remote Tea package, but if you just want to
compile the Java sources and run the Java RPC server, the runtime
component of Remote Tea is included in oncrpc.jar.  Building
the Java RPC server is automatic when Berkeley DB is configured
with the both --enable-rpc and --enable-java.

released code.
