/* A single query thread will try to perform the undo for all successive
versions of a clustered index record, if the transaction has modified it
several times during the execution which is rolled back. It may happen
that the task is transferred to another query thread, if the other thread
is assigned to handle an undo log record in the chain of different versions
of the record, and the other thread happens to get the x-latch to the
clustered index record at the right time.
	If a query thread notices that the clustered index record it is looking
for is missing, or the roll ptr field in the record doed not point to the
undo log record the thread was assigned to handle, then it gives up the undo
task for that undo log record, and fetches the next. This situation can occur
just in the case where the transaction modified the same record several times
and another thread is currently doing the undo for successive versions of
that index record. */
