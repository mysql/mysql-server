/**
 * ClusterJException is the base for all ClusterJ exceptions.
 * Applications can catch ClusterJException to be notified of
 * all ClusterJ reported issues.
 * <p>
 * Exceptions are in three general categories: User exceptions,
 * Datastore exceptions, and Internal exceptions.
 * <ul><li>User exceptions are caused by user error, for example
 * providing a connect string that refers to an unavailable
 * host or port.
 * <ul><li>If a user exception is detected during bootstrapping
 * (acquiring a SessionFactory), it is thrown as a fatal exception.
 * {@link ClusterJFatalUserException}
 * </li><li>If an exception is detected during initialization of a
 * persistent interface, for example annotating a column that
 * doesn't exist in the mapped table, it is reported as a user
 * exception. {@link ClusterJUserException}
 * </li></ul>
 * </li><li>Datastore exceptions report conditions that result
 * from datastore operations after bootstrapping. For example,
 * duplicate keys on insert, or record does not exist on delete.
 * {@link ClusterJDatastoreException}
 * </li><li>Internal exceptions report conditions that are caused
 * by errors in implementation. These exceptions should be reported
 * as bugs. {@link ClusterJFatalInternalException}
 * </li></ul>
