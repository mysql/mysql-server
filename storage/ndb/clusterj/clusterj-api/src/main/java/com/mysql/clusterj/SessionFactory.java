     * to the cluster and is not able to function normally. Reconnection is done in several phases.
     * First, the session factory is set to state Reconnecting and a reconnect thread is started to
     * manage the reconnection procedure. In the Reconnecting state, the getSession methods throw
     * ClusterJUserException and the connection pool is quiesced until all sessions have closed.
     * If sessions fail to close normally after timeout seconds, the sessions are forced to close.
     * Next, all connections in the connection pool are closed, which frees their connection slots
     * in the cluster. Finally, the connection pool is recreated using the original connection pool
     * properties and the state is set to Open.
     * The reconnection procedure is asynchronous. To observe the progress of the procedure, use the
     * methods currentState and getConnectionPoolSessionCounts.
     * If the timeout value is non-zero, automatic reconnection will be done by the clusterj
     * implementation upon recognizing that a network failure has occurred.
