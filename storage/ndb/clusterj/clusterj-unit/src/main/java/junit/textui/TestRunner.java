 * This assortment of classes is a mock http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object
 * implementation of junit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junit. It contains annotations,
 * classes, and interfaces that mock junit for use with test classes 
 * that use a subset of junit functionality. 
 * <p>
 * In clusterj, test classes can use either the real junit or this mock junit.
 * The mock can be used stand-alone or invoked by the maven surefire junit plugin.
 * Other test runners and harnesses might not have been tested and might not work.
 * <p>
 * There is no code copied from Junit itself. Only concepts and names of
 * annotations, interfaces, classes, and methods are copied, which must exactly match
 * the corresponding items from junit in order to be mocked.
