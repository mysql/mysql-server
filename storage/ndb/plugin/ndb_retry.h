/**
  A wrapper to execute the given std::function instance that uses NdbTransaction
  to perform transactions on the data nodes. The transaction has a possibility
  of failing due to a temporary error. In such cases, this wrapper will execute
  the function again after sleeping for some time.

  @note
    A generic std::function instance is used here rather than a generic
    function pointer. This is because the std::function handles the member
    functions better than the function pointers.

  @note
    Execution will be retried only if the THD has not been killed. To disable
    this check, pass nullptr to thd param instead of passing a valid pointer.

  @param ndb                The Ndb object.
  @param thd                THD object pointer.
  @param retry_sleep        The amount of time(in ms) to sleep before retrying
                            in case of a temporary error.
  @param[out] last_ndb_err  The last NdbError in case of failure
  @param ndb_func           The std::function instance of the function that
                            needs to be executed by this wrapper. The function
                            should take a NdbTransaction* parameter followed by
                            any number of other parameters. It should return
                            a const NdbError* on failure and nullptr on success.
  @param args               The arguments that need to be passed to the
                            function during execution.

  @retval true              On success
  @retval false             On failure
