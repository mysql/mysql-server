/*
  Used for communication between the schema distribution Client(which often is
  in a user thread) performing a schema operation and the schema distribution
  Coordinator(which is running as part of the binlog thread).

  The schema distribution Client creates a NDB_SCHEMA_OBJECT before writing
  the schema operation to NDB, then it waits on the NDB_SCHEMA_OBJECT to be
  woken up when the schema operation is completed.

  The schema distribution Coordinator receives new events for the schema
  operation and will update the NDB_SCHEMA_OBJECT with replies and results from
  the other nodes in the cluster. Finally, all other MySQL Servers have replied
  and the schema distribution Client can continue.
