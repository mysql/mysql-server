     *   aggregate of these nests as seen from this table.
     *
     * In the comments for the optimizer code, and this SPJ handler integration

     * t1, (t2,t3,(t4)), which means:

     * - t4 has the upper nest [t2,t3], the aggregated upper nests

     * The sum of the inner- and upper-nests is the 'embedding nests'

     * embedding nest is such that no result row can be created from
     * a row from this table without having a set of rows from all preceding
     * tables in the embedding nest. (Fulfilling any join conditions)
     *
     * The 'embedding nests' plays an important role when analyzing a
     * table for join pushability:
     *
     *  - Assume the previous nest structure: t1, (t2,t3,(t4))
     *  - t2, t3 both refer only t1 in their join conditions.
     *  - t4 refers both t2 and t3: 't4.a = t2.x and t4.b = t3.y'.
     *
     * Thus, the query has the dependency topology:
     *
     *                t1
     *               /  \
     *              t2  t3  (Not directly pushable, see below)
     *               \  /
     *                t4
     *
     * The SPJ implementation require the dependency topology for
     * a SPJ query to be a plain tree topology (implementation legacy).
     * Thus the query above is not directly pushable.
     *
     * We have two mechanisms for helping us in making such queries pushable:
     *  1) SPJ allows us to refer values from any ancestor tables.
     *     (grand-(grand-...)parents).
     *  2) A table is implicitly dependending on any table in the embedding
     *     nests, even if no join condition is refering that table.
     *
     * For the query above we may use this to add an extra dependency from
     * t3 on t2. Furthermore t3's join condition on t1 is made a grand-parent
     * reference to t1, via t2:
     *
     *                          t1
     *                         //
     *                        t2|  <- t1 values passed via t2
     *                         \\  <- Added extra dependency on t2
     *    t2 values, via t3 -> |t3
     *                         //
     *                        t4   (Has a join condition on t2 & t3)
     *
     * Thus we have transformed the query into a pushable query.
     * The SPJ handler integration, in combination with the SPJ API,
     * will add such extra parent dependencies where required, and
     * allowed by checking that references are from within the
     * embedding_nests().

     * tables in its own join nest (inner joined), or on tables from its
     * upper-nest (outer joined), which breaks the requirement above.
     * One such case may be the generic join structure:
     *
     *    t1 ij t2 oj (t3 oj (t4))
     *
     * Assume that we have the join conditions between these tables:

     * - t2 oj t3:  t3.c = t2.b
     * - t3 oj t4:  t4.x = t3.c
     *
     * Thus t4 has the equality set: t4.x = [t1.a,t2.b,t3.c].
     * The optimizer may choose to use this to change the t4 join condition
     * to t4.x = t1.a, resulting in the dependency tree:
     *
     *                t1
     *         (ij)  /  \ (oj)
     *              t2  (t4))

     * Directly transforming this onto a pushed-join queryTree, will break
     * the ::prepareResultSet(), 'child or sibling'-rule. (t4 is not a child
     * or sibling of its 'first_upper' t3).
     * Such cases are resolved by the nest level m_ancestor enforcement:
     *
     *    - We have: t3.m_ancestors = [t1,t2]
     *    - 'first_upper ancestors are enforced on t4:
     *      -> t4.m_ancestors = [t1,t2]
     *
     * Thus, we will enforce the below SPJ-queryTree to be produced:
     *
     *                t1
     *         (ij)  /
     *              t2
     *       (oj)  /  \  (oj)
     *           (t3 (t4))
     *
     * (Note also the nest-dependeny-comments above regarding how extra
     * dependecies between tables in the same inner-nest may be added)
