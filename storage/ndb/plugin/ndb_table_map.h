/** Ndb_table_map
 *
 *   An Ndb_table_map for a table provides a map between MySQL fields and
 *   NDB columns.  Some MySQL fields, such as virtual generated columns, do
 *   not exist in NDB.  Some NDB columns, such as hidden primary keys and
 *   partition ID columns, are not visible as MySQL fields.
 *
 *   Ndb_table_map provides a getColumn() method that wraps
 *   NdbDictionary::Table::getColumn(), translating from a field number to the
 *   appropriate column number.  It also provides a method get_column_mask()
 *   for wholesale translation, when needed, of an entire bitmap of field
 *   numbers to column numbers.
 *
 *   The introduction of virtual generated columns from WL#411 requires the
 *   handler to understand that some fields are not stored, and to map between
 *   MySQL Field Ids and NDB Column Ids (which are no longer equivalent).
 *
