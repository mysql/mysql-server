CRUND
-----

A benchmark that measures the performance of MySQL Server/Cluster APIs for
basic database operations.

The database operations are variations of: Creates, Reads, Updates,
Navigates, and Deletes ("CRUND").

The MySQL Cluster client APIs currently tested by the benchmark are:
- NDB API (C++)
- NDB JTie (Java)
- Cluster/J
- JDBC (MySQL Server)
- Cluster/JDBC (MySQL Server)
- OpenJPA on JDBC (MySQL Server)
- Cluster/JPA: OpenJPA on ClusterJ and JDBC (MySQL Server)

See INSTALL.txt for how to build, configure, and run the CRUND benchmark.
