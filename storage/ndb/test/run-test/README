run-test/README

This document describes how atrt works and how to use it.

atrt is a test program driver.
atrt supports fully distributed test and utilizes ndb_cpcd.

=================================
atrt has the following main loop:

/**
  * Pseudo code for atrt
  */
  read config file (default d.txt)
  contact each ndb_cpcd 
  start each ndb_mgmd
  connect to each ndb_mgmd
  for each read(test case)
  for (run = 1; run < 1 + test_max_retries; run++)
  do
    if previous test failed (or is first test)
      stop each ndbd
      start each ndbd
      wait for ndbd to get started
     
    start each mysqld
     
    start each test prg

    wait while all is running and max time not elapsed

    stop each mysqld

    stop each test prg

    gather result

  done
/**
 * End of pseudo code
 */
