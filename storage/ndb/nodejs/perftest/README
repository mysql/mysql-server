README for mysql-js perftest
last update 18 February 2013

The jscrund.js program is an application written to the node.js api that tests
the performance of various interfaces to MySQL and MySQL Cluster.

The program tests insert, read, and delete performance against a simple schema.

The data used in the program is the same as the data used by the crund benchmark
and performance results can be compared directly with other crund implementations.

To run the tests, call jscrund via node from the command line, e.g. 
  % node jscrund

For usage information, node jscrund -h or node jscrund --help

Various options are available:

adapter: choose ndb, mysql, or sql
  ndb: mysql-js api with the native ndb adapter
  mysql: mysql-js api with the mysql adapter that uses the felix api to access mysqld
  sql: felix api that uses sql to access mysqld

number of records to insert, delete, or read
  default is 4000

mode: choose any or all of indy, each, or bulk
  indy: run in autocommit with each operation in its own transaction
  each: begin, perform all operations, and commit
  bulk: perform all operations in bulk (fewest database round trips)

The schema used in jscrund is in the file create.sql
