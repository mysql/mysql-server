This is some sample application code illustrating Database Jones,
including a pre-built jones-ndb for this version of MySQL Cluster.

This jones-ndb is built using node.js version 18.12.1.
It supports all releases of node.js version 18.x.


For more information about Database Jones, see https://github.com/mysql/mysql-js

To test:

Build and install MySQL.

From the install directory, cd to share/nodejs and install the modules:

 cd share/nodejs    # From the install directory
 npm install database-jones
 npm install jones-mysql
 npm install jones-test
 npm install ./jones-ndb

From the install directory, use mysql-test-run start a MySQL cluster:

  cd mysql-test
  ./mtr --start ndb_basic

After the "Waiting for server(s) to exit..." message appears, you can begin
testing.  First create a user:
  cd share/nodejs   # From the install directory
  ../../bin/mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 --port=13001 < create-test-user.sql

Then run the test suite:
  node run-jones-test-suite.js -E mtr

You should see output ending with something like:

Adapter:  ndb
Elapsed:  10.469 sec.
Started:  499
Passed:   497
Failed:   0
Skipped:  2
