This is some sample application code illustrating Database Jones,
including a pre-built jones-ndb for this version of MySQL Cluster.

This jones-ndb is built using node.js, version 0.12.15.
It will not run with other versions of node.

For more information about Database Jones, see https://github.com/mysql/mysql-js

To test:

npm install database-jones@1.2.3
npm install jones-mysql
npm install jones-test

node run-jones-test-suite.js
