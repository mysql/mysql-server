/* 
   The connector maintains "statistics" -- internal counters recording certain
   important method calls and database operations.
   
   Statistics are stored hierarchically under a global object.
   
   API-level counter names begin with "api", while adapter-level (SPI) counters
   begin with "spi" followed by the name of the adapter.
   
   It is possible to access the statistics through an HTTP server; first, 
   start the server from within application code, then send it a request. 
   The URL pathname components of the request correspond to nodes in the
   hierarchy; "/" corresponds to all statistics; "/spi/ndb" only to NDB 
   adapter-level statistics, and so forth.
   
   The application code itself can also make use of the statistics API to
   record app-level information.

   HOW TO ACCESS THE STATS API:
   var stats_module = require(path.join(api_dir, "stats.js"));

 *  IMMEDIATE
 *  
 *  No return value
