 *  This is designed to take advantage of the ATC (API Thread Contention) fixes
 *  in MySQL Cluster 7.3.

 *  There is no send queue; workers themselves send transactions.
 *  Like the S scheduler, it must support online reconfiguration.
 *  With thread contention fixed, it should use only one connection 
 *  to each cluster.
