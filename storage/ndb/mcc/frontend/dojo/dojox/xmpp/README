Installation instructions

To use the XMPP test, you should have the appropriate server installed on your
machine. We reccomend Openfire, a real time collaboration server licensed under
the Open Source GPL.:
http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/index.jsp

It's very easy to install. Download the version for your machine and launch the installer.
After installation is complete, server settings are made at:
http://127.0.0.1:9090/index.jsp

The settings for the most part are those that suggest the easiest for setup. The main setting
you need to notice is HTTP Binding. This needs to be enabled at port 7070. Also enable
Script Syntax for BOSH clients.

Next go to the top tabs to Users/Groups and create a user or two. It gives you the option to make
a user the Admin - this will overwrite the current Admin.

Now you can launch test_xmppService.html. In the login, use the user ID and password from one of
the users you just created. I used my computer name for Domain, but I'm not sure what this does.
Finally, in HTTP-Bind URL, use the address for Openfire, with the HTTP Bind port of 7070:
http://127.0.0.1:7070/http-bind/

You can open another tab in Firefox and log in as a second user.
