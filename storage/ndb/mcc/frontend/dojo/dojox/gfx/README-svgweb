NOTICE of 3rd party code included
=================================
For ease of testing, latest SVGWeb release is included, see
dojox/gfx/tests/svgweb/README for details.


============================================================
Enable or disable the SVGWeb with dojo gfx
------------------------------------------------------------

The function is only enabled when SVGWeb JS is included and the gfx renderer is
'svg'. If either SVGWeb is not available or the renderer is not 'svg', dojox.gfx
works as usual.

To enable SVGWeb with dojo gfx:

1. Include SVGWeb JS at the FIRST of all your javascripts

	<meta name="svg.render.forceflash" content="true"/>
	<script src="<path>/svgweb/src/svg.js" data-path="<path>/svgweb/src"></script>

2. Force 'svg' renderer with the 'forceGfxRenderer' config

	<script src="<path>/dojo/dojo.js" djConfig="forceGfxRenderer:'svg'"></script>


============================================================
Test dojo gfx + SVGWeb
------------------------------------------------------------

All SVGWeb-specific tests are in dojox/gfx/tests/svgweb.

============================================================
GFX Performance Test Status
------------------------------------------------------------

Runs dojo gfx performance tests on IE7 with different renderers, compare their
performance. The result so far is

    * Silverlight is the fastest: 27,546 ms;
    * Tuned SVGWeb is the 2nd place: 38,690 ms, almost 3 times faster than
	  before
    * VML is the slowest: 50,250 ms


============================================================
GFX Functional Test Status
------------------------------------------------------------

Summary / General findings

    * Pass rate 83%, 25 out of 30 pass
    * The behavior is very consistent on IE & FF
    * Transformation of Text is not working
    * Line style is not working
    * getTextWidth() does not work, see svgweb bug 417
    * IE7 has memory issue, see svgweb bug 418 (IE8 seems fine)

PASS test.roundrect.html
PASS test_arc.html
PASS test_bezier.html
PASS test_decompose.html
PASS test_destroy.html
PASS test_fill.html

FAIL test_fx.html: mostly works, except for the transformation of text (svgweb bug 158)

PASS test_fx_shapes.html
PASS test_gfx.html
PASS test_gradient.html: works, but performance is slow due to the creation of a lot of shapes; using suspendRedraw() helps, but not much; current time is 8.5 seconds on IE7, 3 seconds on FF 3.5
PASS test_group1.html: partly works, but rect highlight change has problem (svgweb bug 296)
PASS test_group2.html: works, with source changed from 'dijit.byId()' to 'dojo.byId()'
PASS test_image1.html
PASS test_image2.html: picture shows, but move and transform has serious problem (svgweb bug 296)

FAIL test_image3.html: picture shows, but move and transform has serious problem (svgweb bug 427, 436)

PASS test_image4.html
PASS test_image5.html: still image gets cropped after dragging, but mostly it's working (svgweb bug 244)
PASS test_linearGradient.html

FAIL test_linestyle.html: not work (svgweb bug 65)

PASS test_pattern.html
PASS test_poly.html
PASS test_resize.html
PASS test_setPath.html
PASS test_tbbox.html: output drawing is incorrect (svgweb bug 296)

FAIL test_text.html: text shows, but the rotation still fails (svgweb bug 158)

FAIL test_textpath.html: not work (svgweb bug 169)

PASS test_transform.html: output drawing is incorrect (svgweb bug 296)
PASS test_utils.html
PASS test_vectortext_draw.html
PASS test_vectortext_load.html: functionally, this works, but very very slow; Reduced the test case to print just 26 chars, in FF it takes 30+ seconds, in IE7 it's more than a minute...
