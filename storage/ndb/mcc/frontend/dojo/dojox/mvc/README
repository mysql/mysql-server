Project description:

Enterprise Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) often focus more on rich data
vs. the rich media aspects of RIAs more typical of consumer applications.
For example, such RIAs depend on implementing the well-known CRUD operations
on data stored in back-end systems. The dojox.mvc project focuses on
separation of MVC concerns on the client, thereby on easing development
of data-rich applications and accelerating the authoring of applications to
Create, Read, Update, and Delete data using a set of Dojo-based patterns.

This project is useful across form factors. For example, it may be used with
dijit as well as dojox.mobile.

We begin by introducing a first-class client-side data model based on
dojo.Stateful and extending Dojo Form widgets with support for the
Model-View-Control (MVC) pattern key to separating data from presentation in
user interface design. This basic MVC pattern allows for the flexible reuse of
each of the Model, View, and Control artifacts by application authors in
varying configurations.

We also add support for a set of commonly needed MVC widgets and containers
such as:
- Output: a data-bound output widget
- Group: an aggregation of widgets with the same parent data binding context
- Repeat: a model-bound repeater widget that binds to a data collection
- Generate: an example of UI generation from a supplied data model

For more, see descriptive class documentation at the top of the following
files:
dojox/mvc/StatefulModel.js
dojox/mvc/_DataBindingMixin.js

Installation instructions:

Grab the following from the Dojo SVN Repository:
  http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/dojox/trunk/mvc.js
  http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/src/dojox/trunk/mvc/*

Install into the following directory structure:
/dojox/mvc.js
/dojox/mvc/*

...which should be at the same level as your Dojo checkout.

then dojo.require("dojox.mvc") in your application to load basic support for
data bindings. Other components (such as MVC containers i.e. Group, Repeat)
should be required as per application need.
