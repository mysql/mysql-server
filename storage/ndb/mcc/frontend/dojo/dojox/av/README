Project description

DojoX A/V aims to bring audio and video capabilities to the Open Web, first
by wrapping common media types (Flash and Quicktime) and then by providing
easy to use objects to accomplish basic A/V tasks.  As of version 0.1, only
the base is included (Flash and Quicktime embedding mechanisms); in the near
future, usable objects will appear, both in raw programmatic form and also with
Dijit-compatible wrappers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependencies:

DojoX A/V depends on dojox.embed, and uses Flash movies created in the deft
project using Flex OSS 3.  You do not need any of the deft code; compiled
movies are included with dojox.av.  If you want to modify the actual movies,
you can look in the deft project (under the package deft.av).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation

TBD.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Included media:

Video:
test/video/Grog.flv and test/video/OldMan.flv are both created by Mike Wilcox
and may be freely used and distributed in any way. I only ask for credit if
widely shown.

Audio:
test/audio/Ola.mp3, test/audio/Hio.mp3, test/audio/FuzzWah.mp3 are from a
sounds effects CD and are not to be redistributed. They will most likely
be swapped out when a better open source option is avaialable.
