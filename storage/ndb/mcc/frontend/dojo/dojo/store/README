This folder contains the stores and utilities implementing the proposed new Dojo Object Store API,
a successor and unifier to Dojo Data, Dojo Storage, and potentially Dojo Model. These
stores are brand new, and designed to provide simple lightweight implementations 
providing core functionality for typical applications. These modules are under active 
development, and exist here at this time to provide maximum visibility to the 
efforts to design and develop this new API and set of base stores. The goal is 
to have these stores ready for Dojo 1.6. In the meantime, these stores are likely to
have API changes, may be missing some functionality, tests, and/or documentation.
If these modules are not deemed suitably stable by the 1.6 release, this directory (or
individual modules) will be removed and be given a later release target.
