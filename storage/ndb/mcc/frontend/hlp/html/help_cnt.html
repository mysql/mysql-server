<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This is the user guide for the MySQL Cluster configuration tool. The aim of this
    tool is to help you configure and deploy NDB Cluster quickly using GUI. It is 
    also a great learning tool. You can read the user guide sequentially, or you can 
    get help regarding the wizard page you are currently at by choosing the proper 
    entry in the Help menu. This user guide is divided into the following main parts: </p>

<ul>
<li><i>Installing and Starting</i> will describe what the system requirements 
    are for running the configuration tool. How to install and start it will 
    also be explained.</li>
<li>The <i>Wizard Overview</i> will provide a high level description of the 
    main parts of the system and how they interact. How to use the configuration 
    tool in terms of navigation, settings, etc. will also be covered. </li>
<li>In <i>Wizard Pages</i>, the individual pages of the wizard will be examined. 
    The various input widgets will be explained in detail. </li>
<!--
<li>Finally, the <i>Troubleshooting</i> section will present various topics 
    that deserve further attention in terms of potentially leading to problems, 
    in particular when starting the MySQL Cluster. </li>
-->
</ul>

<h3>Tool Name</h3>
<p>The configuration tool is a part of the MySQL Cluster Software, and hence, it 
    does not have a particular name. In this user guide, we refer to the 
    <i>(Auto)installer</i>, <i>configurator</i>, <i>configuration tool</i>, 
    <i>configuration wizard</i>, <i>MCC</i> or simply <i>wizard</i>. </p>

<h2><a name="installingAndStarting">Installing and Starting</a></h2>
<p>The configuration tool is installed together with the MySQL Cluster software. 
    Please refer to the <span id="docUrlRoot"></span> 
    regarding installation. This section describes the requirements to the 
    environment of the tool, important information about security, and explains 
    how to start the wizard. </p>

<!-- ======================= Installation layout =========================== -->

<h3><a name="installationLayout">Installation Layout</a></h3>

<p>The configuration tool may end up in various locations depending on the 
    context (note that the default paths may be overridden at install time for 
    some package formats). </p>

<h3><a name="limitations">Limitations</a></h3>
<p><ul>
    <li>The tool works at least with MySQL NDB Cluster version 7.6 and up.</li>
    <li>We do not support installing Cluster processes on hosts. Please make sure 
        each host in the cluster has proper installation of MySQL software. This is 
        the limitation in the current version.</li>
    <li>You can not mix your local box with remote hosts. If you still wish to use 
        your local box, please enter proper external IP address for HOST::Name and 
        avoid using 127.0.0.1/localhost.</li>
    <li>We are constantly updating configurable parameters but there is always a 
        chance the tool is missing some of them.</li>
</ul></p>

<!-- ======================== Wizard options =============================== -->

<h3><a name="wizardOptions">Wizard Options</a></h3>
<p>The wizard supports the following command line options: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>-h, --help </b> show this help message and exit</li>
<li><b>-N SERVER_NAME, --server_name=SERVER_NAME </b> server name: [default: localhost]</li>
<li><b>-p PORT, --port=PORT </b> port for the web server: [default: 8081]</li>
<li><b>-n, --no-browser </b> do not open the server's start page in a browser</li>
<li><b>-s BROWSER_START_PAGE, --browser-start-page=BROWSER_START_PAGE </b> start 
    page for browser: [default: index.html]</li>
<li><b>-d DEBUG_LEVEL, --debug-level=DEBUG_LEVEL </b> Python logging module 
    debug level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR or CRITICAL). [default: WARNING]</li>
<li><b>-o SERVER_LOG_FILE, --server-log-file=SERVER_LOG_FILE </b> log requests to 
    this file. The value - means log to stderr: [default: ndb_setup-1541.log]</li>
<li><b>-H, --use-http </b> use http for communication with browser.</li>
<li><b>-S, --use-https </b> use https to secure communication with browser</li>

    of client certificates allowed to connect to the server [default: none (no 
    client authentication)]</li>
</ul>
<p>If no options are given, we default to HTTPS (-S) using self-signed certificate provided 
with the software. If you want to use HTTP you have to add -H (or --use-http) to command
line.
</p>
<!-- ====================== Starting the wizard ============================ -->

<h3><a name="startingTheWizard">Starting the Wizard</a></h3>
<p>First, you need to identify the directory where the <tt>ndb_setup</tt> tool 
    is located. This location depends on which package was downloaded and how 
    it was installed. Then, you can start in the following ways: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>From the command line: </b> Either change current directory to the one 
    identified above, or enter the command prefixed by its absolute or relative 
    path. </li>
<li><b>Double clicking the appropriate icon: </b> Open the file browser, go to 
    the appropriate directory, identify the <tt>ndb_setup</tt> executable, and 
    double click it. </li>
<li><b>Note: </b> Web server is Python process started in shell. Please refer
    to on-screen instructions on how to stop it properly. If you exit the shell 
    abruptly, you might need to manually remove mcc.pid file before retrying. </li>
</ul>

<!-- ====================== Supported platforms ============================ -->

<h3><a name="supportedPlatforms">Supported Platforms</a></h3>
<p>The configuration tool makes it a top priority to support the 
    following platforms: </p>

<ul>
<li>Generic Linux</li>
<li>Oracle Linux 6 and 7</li>
<li>SUSE Linux</li>
<li>Windows 2016</li>
<li>Windows 10</li>
<li>Windows 7</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the tool will attempt, as far as possible, to support the 
    following platforms: </p>

<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 11</li>
<li>Windows Vista</li>
<li>Solaris 11 Sparc</li>
<li>Solaris 11 x86</li>
<li>Mac OS x 10.7</li>
</ul>

<!-- ======================= Supported browsers ============================ -->

<h3><a name="supportedBrowsers">Supported Browsers</a></h3>
<p>The configuration tool makes it a top priority to support the following 
    browsers: </p>

<ul>
<li>Firefox</li>
<li>Chrome</li>
<li>Safari</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the following browsers are supported as far as possible: </p>

<ul>
<li>Opera</li>
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>
<li>Microsoft Edge</li>
</ul>

<p>There have been no issues detected with Microsoft Edge browser. However, IE insists 
   on parsing DOJO requirements too early in the process which effectively disables 
   loading DIJIT templates from cache thus forcing load from different domain. As cross-
   domain scripting is disabled in IE by default, should the problem occur you will have 
   to change Internet options/Security/Miscellaneous/Access datasources across domains 
   to ENABLE or PROMPT for MCC to work. Also, local sites can trigger "compatibility 
   mode" in IE thus rendering happens with some decade old engine. In such case, uncheck 
   Internet options/Advanced/Go to an intranet site for...</p>

<!-- ======================== Required software ============================ -->

<h3><a name="requiredSoftware">Required Software</a></h3>

<p>The following software must be installed on the host where the configuration 
    tool is started: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Python: </b> Interpreter and libraries for the configuration tool. 
    Version 2.6 or higher is required, and can be downloaded from 
    <a href="http://python.org/download/">http://python.org/download/</a></li>
<li><b>Paramiko: </b> SSH implementation required to communicate with remote hosts. 
    Version 2 or higher is required, and can be downloaded from 
    <a href="http://www.lag.net/paramiko/">http://www.lag.net/paramiko/</a></li>
<li><b>Cryptography: </b> Cryptography module required by Paramiko. Version 1.9 or 
    higher is required, and can be installed with $ pip install cryptography.</li>
<li>For development, we use Python 2.7.13, Paramiko 2.1.2 and cryptography 1.9.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you install the Windows version of the configuration tool, the above 
    software comes bundled and is installed automatically. If you intend to 
    deploy MySQL Cluster only on the same host as the configuration tool is 
    running, you will not need Paramiko. </p>

<p>The following software must be installed on the remote hosts that will be 
    used to deploy the MySQL Cluster: </p>
<ul>
<li><b>SSH server: </b>Most Linux and Solaris distributions run this as default. 
    For Windows users, see e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_servers">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_servers</a> 
    for an overview of SSH servers. </li>
<li><b>User authentication: </b> This is no particular software, of course, but 
    the user wanting to access the remote host must be able to authenticate 
    through SSH by means of user credentials or keys. </li>
</ul>

<!-- ============================ Security ================================= -->

<h3><a name="security">Security</a></h3>
<p>Three basic security mechanisms may be utilized by the configuration tool: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>SSH: </b>Secure shell is used to enable the back end to perform actions 
    on remote hosts. Thus, the remote host being accessed must have an SSH server 
    up and running. Additionally, the configuration tool user must have access 
    to the remote server by means of a <i>user name and password</i>, or by <i>keys</i>. </li>
<li><b>https: </b>Communication between the front end and the back end is not 
    encrypted by default. This means that e.g. the SSH password is transmitted 
    in a format that is readable to anyone. For communication to be encrypted, 
    the back end must have a <i>certificate</i>, and the front end must 
    communicate with the back end using <i>https</i> rather than <i>http</i>. 
    The easiest way to enable this is to issue a <i>self signed certificate</i>. 
    After the certificate is issued, it must be made available to, and used by, 
    the back end. This can be done by starting the wizard with the options 
    <tt>--use-https</tt> and <tt>--cert-file=&lt;certificate file name&gt;</tt>.
    We provide sample certificate in root directory (cfg.pem) so using just
    <tt>-S</tt> should suffice to get you going.</li>
<li><b>Authentication: </b>The back end process can execute commands on its 
    local host as well as remote hosts. Thus, anyone connecting to the back end 
    can take charge of how commands are executed. To reject unwanted connections 
    to the back end, certificates may be used for authentication of the client. 
    Thus, a certificate must be issued by the user, installed in the browser, 
    and made available to the back end for authentication purposes. This can be 
    done by starting the back end with the option 
    <tt>--ca-certs-file=&lt;certificate list file name&gt;</tt>.</li>
<li><b>Configuration file: </b>Configuration is saved to file with extension .mcc
    in current users HOME directory. File is encrypted with Fernet. Passphrase,
    provided by user, is used to generate SHA256 key for AES 128 encryption.
    Beware that, much like above, passphrase is sent plain text from front end to
    back end so HTTPS is highly recommended.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="wizardOverview">Wizard overview</a></h2>
<p>Two main components comprise the cluster configuration tool: </p>

<ul>
<li>The <i>front end</i> is a client implemented in Javascript, running in your favorite web browser.
<li>The <i>back end</i> is a server implemented in Python, running on your desktop or on another host. 
</ul>

<p>The two main components communicate using messages wrapped in http(s). The back 
    end can manage MySQL cluster software on any host. If the software is on the 
    same host as the back end itself, the Python interfaces are used for file 
    system operations, process manipulation, etc. If the MySQL Cluster software 
    is on another host, the back end relies on SSH access the hosts, using the 
    Paramiko package for executing commands remotely. </p>

<p>The remainder of this section will describe overall usage of the wizard in 
    terms of navigating between pages, various settings, and how to get help. </p>

<!-- =========================== Navigation ================================ -->

<h3><a name="navigation">Navigation</a></h3>
<p>The configuration tool is implemented as a wizard with a number of pages 
    covering different steps. There are two ways to navigate between pages. 
    First, the <i>navigation toolbar</i> or <i>breadcrumb trail</i> displays the 
    titles of the various pages. A specific page can be selected by clicking the 
    page title: </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/breadcrumb_trail.png" alt="Breadcrumb trail">
</p>

<p>In the breadcrumb trail, the title of the current page is highlighted. The 
    advantage of the breadcrumb trail is that you can jump more than one page 
    in either direction. </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/page_buttons.png" alt="Page buttons">
</p>

<p>The second navigation mechanism is to use the three navigation buttons at the 
    bottom of the page. These can be used to advance to the next or previous 
    page, or to go to the very last page. The buttons are disabled as needed, 
    e.g., if you are at the last page, the <i>Next</i> and <i>Finish</i> buttons 
    are disabled, while if you are on the first page, the <i>Prev</i> button is 
    disabled. </p>

<!-- =========================== Settings ================================== -->

<h3><a name="settings">Settings</a></h3>
<p>At the top right in the wizard window, next to the <i>Help</i> menu, you will 
    find the <i>Settings</i> menu: </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/settings_menu.png" alt="Settings menu">
</p>

<p>The various menu entries in the Settings menu are: </p>

<ul>
<li><i>Automatically save configuration as cookies: </i>This option is now always
    on saving general information such as items for drop down lists and such. </li>
<li><i>Show advanced configuration options: </i>This setting means that advanced 
    configuration parameters will be visible in the wizard and editable for the 
    user. The advanced parameters will always be used in the configuration file, 
    this setting just controls whether they are visible in the wizard. </li>
<li><i>Automatically get resource information for new hosts: </i>With this setting 
    checked, new hosts that are added will be queried automatically for hardware 
    resource information. The information can be overridden afterwards if desired.
    We recommend leaving this option ON for simple Cluster (i.e. one where same set
    credentials works for all hosts) skipping need to refresh host information. On 
    Cluster where each host has it's own credentials worst thing that can happen is
    an alert window saying we were unable to collect host info. Once you provide
    proper credentials on Hosts list page, you can refresh it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the entries in the menu might be disabled if they are irrelevant due 
    to choices you have made in the wizard. We will come back to that later in 
    this user guide. </p>

<!-- ========================= Getting help ================================ -->

<h3><a name="gettingHelp">Getting Help</a></h3>
<p>At the very top right in the wizard window, next to the <i>Settings</i> menu, 
    you will find the <i>Help</i> menu: </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/help_menu.png" alt="Help menu">
</p>

<p>The various menu entries in the Help menu are: </p>

<ul>
<li><i>Content: </i> This will show the user guide (i.e., the document you are 
    currently reading) in a separate window, so you can read it while using the 
    wizard. </li>
<li><i>Current page: </i> This will open the user guide at the section describing 
    the page currently displayed in the wizard. </li>
<li><i>About: </i>This will show a small dialog displaying the tool name and 
    version number. </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the help menu, there are tool tips for most of the input widgets. 
    They are displayed when you hover the widget, or there is a small orange 
    question mark next to the widget's label which can be hovered for help. 
    For the configuration parameters, the parameter names are linked to the 
    MySQL Cluster documentation, so if you click the parameter name, the 
    appropriate documentation is displayed in a separate frame. </p>

<h2><a name="wizardPages">Wizard Pages</a></h2>
<p>This section will describe the various wizard pages in detail. </p>

<!--============================ Welcome =================================== -->

<h3><a name="welcome">Welcome</a></h3>

<p>The first page displayed after the <tt>ndb_setup</tt> command is invoked is 
    the <i>welcome</i> page. Here, you have three major areas: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Radio box with configurations: </b> Upon startup, backend lists all non empty
    .mcc files from current user HOME and sends the list to front end in URL. Front end
    then appends NEW CONFIGURATION (default item). This is the first choice to make. If
    you choose "NEW CONFIGURATION" and leave Radio box (say, by clicking to PASSPHRASE box),
    you will be prompted to enter the name for new configuration. You can omit .mcc part. </li>
<li><b>PASSPHRASE/CONFIRM PP: </b> Passphrase is used to secure your configuration file.
    If you choose "NEW CONFIGURATION", you will have to confirm the passphrase. If you
    choose existing configuration, you will be moved to PASSPHRASE box immediately and 
    you will not need to confirm it.</li>
<li><b>VIEW CFG: </b> The button is disabled until all the requirements are met:
    - Configuration is picked, passphrase is provided.
    The validation code is triggered when you leave PASSPHRASE/CONFIRM PP boxes either
    by pressing ENTER or TAB.</li>
<li><b>CONTINUE: </b> The button is disabled until all the requirements are met:
    - Configuration is picked.
    - In case you picked existing configuration, passphrase is provided.
    - In case you picked "NEW CONFIGURATION", passphrase is provided as well as
    matching confirmation.
    The validation code is triggered when you leave PASSPHRASE/CONFIRM PP boxes either
    by pressing ENTER or TAB.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/welcome.png" width="800" alt="Welcome page">
</p>

<p>Once you click CONTINUE button, the back end server will get contacted to read from
    chosen configuration and pass decrypted data back. This information, including your
    credentials for Cluster/host(s) will then get attached to window.name environment
    variable and passed to next page where it will be loaded into in-memory stores.
    <br/>Providing existing configuration name when prompted for "NEW CONFIGURATION" name is 
    not treated as error. MCC will simply read the existing configuration and proceed.
    <br/>VIEW CFG button displays pop-up window with configuration details. Can be blocked by 
    browser's pop-up blocker.
</p>

<!-- ======================== Define cluster =============================== -->

<h3><a name="configWizardDefineCluster">Define Cluster</a></h3>
<p>On <i>define cluster</i> page you can decide on overall settings for the
    cluster you are going to configure. Setting provided here are "Cluster-wide"
    meaning for every host added, if there are no per-host entries, these will
    be used. This allows for quick deployment of simple configurations where
    there is just localhost or where, for example, credentials are the same for
    every host in Cluster. There are also receipts for various Cluster settings
    depending on what you want (see below).
    Please note that you can override any of the settings here later in the process.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/define_cluster.png" width="800" alt="Define cluster">
</p>

<p>The page contains the following fields: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Cluster name: </b>This field reflects loaded cluster configuration
    name and so it can't be changed. </li>
<li><b>Host list: </b>Here, a comma separated list of host names can be added. 
    The default is to list only <i>127.0.0.1</i>, which means the host where 
    the <tt>ndb_setup</tt> command was issued. Host names can be added to or 
    deleted from this list. If a host name is deleted, the processes configured 
    to run on that host will also be deleted. This is convenient way to add host(s)
    especially if they all use same basic credentials (unencrypted PK or user 
    /password combination). If you want more control over your hosts definition, 
    or you have hosts in Cluster with different credentials, you can leave this box 
    completely empty.</li>
<li><b>Application area: </b>This describes the overall way the cluster will be 
    used. You can choose between the following three receipts: 
    <ul>
    <li><b>Simple testing: </b>Here, the cluster will require little hardware 
        resources, but this will also make the cluster performance suffer greatly. 
        This application area should not be used in a production context. </li>
    <li><b>Web application: </b>For a web application, the configuration parameters 
        will be defined in a way that maximizes performance, given the host hardware 
        resources. </li>
    <li><b>Realtime: </b>The realtime configuration is much the same as the web 
        application, the difference is that the realtime configuration is more 
        sensitive to timeouts in the heartbeat mechanism to detect failing 
        processes faster. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
<li><b>Write load: </b>You get to choose among the following receipts: 
    <ul>
    <li><b>Low: </b>This is assumed to be less than 100 write transactions per 
        second for the entire cluster. </li>
    <li><b>Medium: </b>This is assumed to be between 100 and 1000 write transactions 
        per second for the entire cluster. </li>
    <li><b>High: </b>This is assumed to be more than than 1000 write transactions 
        per second for the entire cluster. </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
<li><b>SSH Property: </b>Here you can specify the use of SSH credentials to 
    access remote host(s). If your host list (see above) only contains <i>127.0.0.1</i>, 
    no SSH credentials are required. The credentials that can be specified are: 
    <ul>
    <li><b>Key based SSH: </b>Check this box if you have enabled key based login

<!-- ========================= Define hosts ================================ -->

<h3><a name="configWizardDefineHosts">Define Hosts</a></h3>
<p>After the overall cluster properties have been defined, you can refine the 
    host details as well as define new hosts. The wizard page is shown below: </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/define_hosts.png" width="800" alt="Define hosts">
</p>

<p>Here, hosts can be added by pressing the <i>Add hosts</i> button and entering 
    host name or Host external ip address as well as credentials. Field <i>Key_file<i> 
    should point to private key file to be used with selected host
    (i.e. C:\Users\user\.ssh\key_file_name). If the key has default name (id_rsa),
    it will be automatically picked up by Paramiko.
    <br><b>Host external ip address:</b> IP address making host accessible from the box MCC is 
    running on.
    <br><b>Host internal ip address:</b> Imagine you have five hosts Cluster running on Oracle
    Cloud then, in this field, you would enter the IP address used inside cloud service 
    for safer and faster communication between hosts.
    <br>The hosts currently entered are displayed in the grid with various pieces of
    information. A host, or a selection of hosts, can be removed from the 
    configuration by pressing <i>Remove selected host(s)</i> button. If processes 
    have been configured to run on these hosts, the processes will be removed from 
    the configuration too: </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/add_host.png" width="240" alt="Define hosts">
</p>

<p>If the setting <i>Automatically get resource information for new hosts</i> is 
    checked in the settings menu (see previous section), the platform name, RAM 
    size and number of CPU cores will be filled in automatically and displayed 
    in the grid. Otherwise, an ellipsis in the grid will indicate that the 
    information was not obtained. The status of the automated resource 
    information fetching is displayed in the <i>Resource info</i> column. Please 
    note that fetching the information may take some time, particularly on  
    Windows hosts. Should the automatic resource fetch fail, correct the host 
    information by clicking <i>Edit selected host</i> button and refetch by clicking 
    <i>Refresh selected host(s)</i> button.
</p>

<p>If the SSH user credentials on the <i>define cluster</i> page are changed, 
    the tool will try to re-fetch the hardware information for hosts where a 
    piece of information is missing. When the information is re-fetched, the 
    various fields will be updated. If a field has been edited by the user, the 
    information will <i>not</i> be overwritten by the re-fetched value.</p>

<p>The hardware resource information, platform name, install directory, data 
    directory and free disk space can be edited by the user by clicking the 
    appropriate cell in the grid. It is also possible to select a host and press 
    the button <i>Edit selected host(s)</i>. Then, a dialog will appear where various 
    fields can be edited. The edited values will be applied to selected host: </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/edit_selected_hosts.png" width="600" alt="Edit selected hosts">
</p>

<p>Please note that REPO/DOCKER install details are available for editing only on
    this screen.<br>
    Turning your attention to two more things: I do not have "user" supplied but
    just Passphrase. This is indicative of my key being id_rsa and placed in ~/.ssh.<br>
    Also, I am deploying Cluster in VPN so instead of "supra07.no...." I have proper 
    IP address, not accessible from the outside, in "Host internal IP" box. This will 
    allow Cluster to skip resolving names.
</p>

<h4>Details on hosts naming</h4>
<p>One should always keep in mind the goal, i.e. deployment of the Cluster processes 
    over any number of hosts. Thus it is best to refer to Hosts via their external IP 
    address. I.e., for anything other than simple deployment just on localhost, you 
    should follow these rules:
    <ul>
    <li><b>HOST::Name: </b> 
        External IP address of the host making it possible for MCC to reach it via SSH tunnel. </li>
    <li><b>HOST::FQDN: </b>
        Internal field to be used when forming connection string (see below). </li>
    <li><b>HOST::InternalIP: </b>
        When processes run inside cloud/VPN, put internal IP address of the environment here.
        This way you will allow processes on hosts to communicate in fastest way.</li>
    <li><b>Initial values: </b>
        HOST::Name is propagated to both HOST::FQDN and HOST::InternalIP members.</li>
    </ul><br/>
    The nodes are governed by config.ini file, distributed to each one, containing hosts 
    designation on per process basis as well as connection strings. It might look like this:<br/>
    <code>[NDB_MGMD]
    <br/>NodeId=49
    <br/>HostName=10.172.165.190
    <br/>DataDir=C:/Users/user/MySQL_Cluster/49/
    <br/>Portnumber=1186
    <br/>[NDBD]
    <br/>NodeId=2
    <br/>HostName=10.172.162.24
    <br/>DataDir=C:/Users/user/MySQL_Cluster/2/</code><br/>
    In this particular case, HostName=10.172.162.24 is actually localhost. The reason
    to define it as 10.172.162.24 and not "localhost" lies in that when config.ini is 
    distributed to second host, 127.0.0.1 will point to that host (10.172.165.190) and 
    the Cluster will not start. This is why you cannot mix 127.0.0.1/localhost with
    remote hosts.<br/>
    It is necessary for you to also enter Internal IP when adding/editing hosts if Cluster 
    is running inside VPN (say Cloud deployment).<br/>
    Let's recapitulate various scenarios:
    <ul>
    <li><b>Small localhost deployment: </b> 
        Enter 127.0.0.1 or localhost in HostList on 1st page. </li>
    <li><b>Small deployment, home or office network: </b>
        Enter proper IP address of your localhost into HostList on 1st page, add other 
        hosts using "Add Host" button on next page. Ignore InternalIP member. </li>
    <li><b>Deployment to Cloud/other VPN environment: </b>
        When adding hosts on 2nd page, fill in Internal IP member. Name hosts by their 
        external IP address. </li>
    </ul>
    MCC will always use <b>FQDN</b> member to connect, distribute configuration and start processes.
    Configuration files and Cluster processes will always use <b>Internal IP</b> member.
    This way the communication between nodes will be as fast as possible and bypassing any 
    errors on DNS level.
</p>

<p>Finally, HostGrid can have two states, collapsed (default): </p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/hostgrid-collapsed.png" width="600" alt="HostGrid collapsed">
</p>
<p>and expanded: </p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/hostgrid-expanded.png" width="600" alt="HostGrid collapsed">
</p>
<p>toggled by Show/Hide extended info button. </p>

<p>The <b>Save&amp;Next</b> button sends asynchronous request for your changes to be saved into
    chosen configuration file in your HOME and advances to next page. If you close the
    wizard here, no changes you made will be saved.</p>

<!-- ======================= Define processes ============================== -->

<h3><a name="configWizardDefineProcesses">Define Processes</a></h3>
<p>After the hosts have been defined, the next step is to define which processes 
    should be part of the cluster. This page is shown below: </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/define_processes.png" width="800" alt="Define processes">
</p>

<p>There are two main areas here, there is a <i>process tree</i> to the left, 
    with the various hosts and the processes configured to run on them. To the 
    right is an information pane which displays information about the currently 
    selected item in the tree. When the user enters this page the first time for 
    a cluster configuration, a set of processes is defined as default. The 
    processes defined depend on the number of hosts. If the user goes back to 
    the previous page, removes all hosts, and adds other hosts, then a new set 
    of processes will also be defined. </p>

<p>The processes are of the following main types: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Management node: </b>Node for administrative tasks such as stopping 
    individual data nodes, querying status, running backup, etc. </li>
<li><b>Single threaded data node: </b>Node for storing the actual data and 
    executing queries. </li>
<li><b>Multi threaded data node: </b>Same as above, but with several working 
    threads executing in parallel. </li>
<li><b>SQL node: </b>MySQL server for executing SQL queries against the database. </li>
<li><b>API node: </b>Node accessing the database through a proprietary API rather than SQL. </li>
</ul>

<p> In the process tree to the left, each node has a numeric suffix, which is 
    incremented for each new process of that type. This is just to be able to 
    tell the different processes apart. In the tree, in addition to the hosts 
    you enter, there is a special entry <i>Any host</i>. This special "host" is 
    really just a placeholder where processes that should be allowed to run on 
    an arbitrary host may be located. Usually, a process is configured to run 
    on a specific host, and thus will not be allowed to run on an arbitrary host. 
    If this is desirable, the process should be added to the <i>Any host</i> 
    entry. Please note that only API processes may be located on the special 
    entry<i>Any host</i>. </p>

<p>In the process tree, you can right click a host for a pop up menu displaying 
    an entry <i>Add process</i>. Selecting this entry will take you to the 
    <i>add process dialog</i>. Alternatively, you can select a host, and press 
    the <i>Add process</i> button below the process tree. The 
    <i>add process dialog</i> lets you select among the available process types, 
    and you can also enter an arbitrary process name instead of the default 
    suggestion:  </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/add_process.png" width="400" alt="Add process">
</p>

<p>In the tree, you can also right click a process and select <i>delete process</i> 
    from the pop up menu, or select a process and press the <i>delete process</i> 
    button below the process tree. If a process is selected in the process tree, 
    information about that process is displayed in the information pane to the 
    right. You may edit the process name, and you may change the process type to 
    another compatible type. Currently, the only compatible process types are 
    the two variants of the data node; single threaded or multi threaded. If you 
    want to change to an entirely different type, you need to delete the process 
    first, and then add a new process with the desired type. </p>

<p>The <b>Save&amp;Next</b> button sends asynchronous request for your changes to be saved into
    chosen configuration file in your HOME and advances to next page. If you close the
    wizard here, no changes you made will be saved.</p>

<!-- ======================= Define parameters ============================= -->

<h3><a name="configWizardDefineParameters">Define Parameters</a></h3>
<p>The page for defining parameters looks somewhat similar to the previous page 
    for defining processes. To the left is a tree with the processes, to the 
    right is a pane with information regarding the currently selected tree item: </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/define_parameters.png" width="800" alt="Define parameters">
</p>

<p>However, looking at this in more detail, we see that the process tree is 
    organized differently. On the previous page, it reflected which hosts the 
    processes were running on, whereas on this page, it shows the processes 
    grouped by process type. Thus, the root nodes in the tree are the process 
    types, and the children are the process instances. You may notice that the 
    compatible processes are grouped into the same process type, hence, the two 
    data node processes will both be in the <i>Data layer</i> process type. </p>

<p>Below the process tree, you will see a check box labeled 
    <i>Show advanced configuration parameters</i>. This check box will make advanced 
    parameters visible or hidden in the information pane to the right. If you, 
    e.g., select the <i>Data layer</i> process group, you will see that toggling 
    the check box makes a lot of parameters appear or disappear in the pane to 
    the right. The significance of this visibility is only that the parameters 
    need to be visible for you to be able to change them. The parameters will be 
    set anyway and used in the configuration of the cluster. </p>

<p>Now, the purpose of this page is to define the various configuration parameters 
    for the processes. This can be done in two main ways: </p>

<ul>
<li>If a <i>process instance</i> is selected in the tree to the left, a list of 
    available configuration parameters is displayed in the information pane to 
    the right. If a parameter is changed, then it will apply <i>only to the selected process</i>.</li>
<li>If a <i>process group</i> is selected in the tree to the left, you will also 
    see a list of available configuration parameters in the pane to the right. 
    However, if you change a parameter in this pane, the changed value will 
    apply to <i>all process instances  in that process group unless the instance 
    also has an overridden value for the parameter that was changed</i>. Thus, 
    parameter changes done for a process instance will overrule changes done for 
    the process group. </li>
</ul>

<p>When a process group or process instance is selected, you will see, e.g., the 
    following information in the pane to the right (if an SQL process is selected): </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/mysqld_parameters.png" width="800" alt="Parameters for mysqld">
</p>

<p>In the information pane shown above, you see the various parameter names, their 
    values, and for some of them, there is also a green button with a plus sign 
    to the right. That button means that the parameter can be overridden. Thus, 
    if you push the button, the input widget for the parameter will be enabled, 
    and you will be able to change its value. The various parameters will have 
    predefined values. If you, e.g., look at the parameter <i>DataDir</i> you 
    will see it is a predefined path. This path is constructed based on the host 
    on which the process will run, taking the data directory you entered for 
    this host on the <i>define hosts</i> page, and appending the node id. All 
    configuration parameters displayed by the tool will have predefined values, 
    and usually, the values may just be left as they are. It is highly 
    recommended that you read the documentation before making changes to the 
    parameter values. Each parameter name is a hyper link into the MySQL 
    documentation, so it is easy to find the relevant information. </p>

<p>If a configuration parameter has been changed, you may revert the change and 
    go back to the predefined value: When the value has been overridden, the 
    green button with a plus sign turns into a big red X, as shown below: </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/mysqld_parameters_overridden.png" width="800" alt="Overriding parameters">
</p>

<p>Now, if you press this red X, the change is reverted, and the parameter is 
    reset to the predefined value. </p>

<p>The <b>Save&amp;Next</b> button sends asynchronous request for your changes to be saved into
    chosen configuration file in your HOME and advances to next page. If you close the
    wizard here, no changes you made will be saved.</p>


<!-- ======================== Deploy configuration ========================= -->

<h3><a name="configWizardDeployConfig">Deploy Configuration</a></h3>
<p>The last page in the wizard is the <i>deployment page</i>. Here, you can 
    inspect the startup commands and actual configuration files that will be 
    applied, you can distribute the configuration files and create the necessary 
    files and directories on the hosts involved, and you can start and stop the 
    cluster you have configured. Currently, "Install" button is not in effect. The 
    page looks similar to the previous one: </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/deploy.png" width="800" alt="Deploy configuration">

<p>To the left, you will find the same process tree as on the previous page. The 
    processes are listed grouped by the process type they belong to. To the right 
    of the process tree, there are two information panes. The upper one will 
    display the startup commands necessary to start the process. For some 
    processes, more than one command may be required, e.g. if initialization is 
    needed. The lower pane will show the contents of the configuration file for 
    the given process. Currently, the only processes having a configuration file 
    are the <i>management nodes</i>. The other processes are configured by means 
    of command line parameters submitted with the startup command, or by getting 
    their configuration parameters by asking the management nodes dynamically. </p>

<p>In the process tree, the icons in front of the processes will change 
    depending on the status of the processes. I.e., when the cluster starts or 
    stops, the icons will turn red (stopped), yellow (starting or stopping) or 
    green (running). This status information is based on querying the management 
    daemon. </p>

<p>Below the process three, you will find four buttons: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Install cluster: </b>Not available in this version. </li>
<li><b>Deploy cluster: </b>First, the configuration is verified, e.g., if you 
    have specified the same value for two different data directories, you will 
    not be allowed to deploy the configuration. Secondly, the required directories 
    are created on the hosts involved, and the configuration files are distributed 
    onto the hosts. A progress bar will show how the deployment proceeds. </li>
<li><b>Start cluster: </b>First, the configuration is deployed and the 
    directories are created, i.e., the same as the above. Then, the processes 
    that are defined are started in the correct order. Please note that starting 
    the processes may take some time. If the estimated time usage is large, you 
    will be alerted and asked to cancel or confirm continuation of the startup 
    procedure. A progress bar will inform you about the current status of the 
    startup procedure, and the icons in the process tree will also indicate how 
    the start progresses. </li>
<li><b>Stop cluster: </b>When the cluster has been started, you may stop it 
    using the <i>Stop</i> button. Here, you will also see a progress bar displaying 
    the current status of the stopping procedure, and the icons the process tree 
    are also updated regularly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an example of a progress bar displayed while starting the cluster: </p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="../img/starting_cluster.png" width="800" alt="Starting cluster">
</p>

<p>It is worth noticing that the configuration tool cannot guarantee that the 
    cluster is available for usage when it has been started. Hence, after the 
    processes have been started, you will be informed that the processes are 
    starting, but may need some time to initialize before they are ready for 
    usage.  </p>
