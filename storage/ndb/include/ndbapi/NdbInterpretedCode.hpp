  @brief Stand-alone interpreted programs, for use with NdbRecord

  @details This class is used to prepare an NDB interpreted program for use
  in operations created using NdbRecord, or scans created using the old
  API.  The ScanFilter class can also be used to generate an NDB interpreted
  program using NdbInterpretedCode.

  Usage :
    1) Create NdbInterpretedCode object, optionally supplying a table
       for the program to operate on, and a buffer for program storage
       and finalisation
       Note : 
       - If no table is supplied, then only instructions which do not
       access table attributes can be used.
       - If no buffer is supplied, then an internal buffer will be
       dynamically allocated and extended as necessary.
    2) Add instructions and labels to the NdbInterpretedCode object 
       by calling the methods below.
    3) When the program is complete, finalise it by calling the 
       finalise() method.  This will resolve internal branches and
       calls to label and subroutine offsets.
    4) Use the program with NdbRecord operations and scans by passing
       it at operation definition time via the OperationOptions or
       ScanOptions parameters.
       Alternatively, use the program with old-Api scans by passing it
       via the setInterpretedProgram() method.
    5) When the program is no longer required, the NdbInterpretedCode
       object can be deleted, along with any user-supplied buffer.

  Notes : 
    a) Each NDBAPI operation applies to one table, and so does any 
       NdbInterpretedCode program attached to that operation.
    b) A single finalised NdbInterpretedCode program can be used by
       more than one operation.  It need not be 'rebuilt' for each
       operation.
    c) Methods have minimal error checks, for efficiency
    d) Note that this interface may be subject to change without notice.
       The NdbScanFilter API is a more stable Api for defining scan-filter
       style programs.
