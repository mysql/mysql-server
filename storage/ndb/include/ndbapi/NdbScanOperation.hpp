      Return rows from an index scan sorted, ordered on the index key.
      Both ascending order or descending order scans are affected by this flag.
      This flag makes the API perform a merge-sort among the ordered scans of
      each fragment, to get a single sorted result set.
      Note that :
      1) Ordered indexes are distributed - there is one for each fragment of a
         table.
      2) Range scans are often parallel - across all index fragments.  
         Occasionally they can be pruned to one index fragment.
      3) Each index fragment range scan will return results in either ascending
         or descending order.  Ascending is the default, but descending is
         chosen if SF_Descending is set.
      4) Where multiple index fragments are scanned in parallel, the results
         are sent back to NdbApi where they can optionally be merge-sorted
         before being returned to the user.  This merge sorting is controlled
         via the SF_OrderBy and SF_OrderByFull flags.
      5) Without SF_OrderBy* flags, the results from each index fragment will
         be in-order (ascending or descending), but results from different
         fragments may be interleaved.
      6) With SF_OrderBy* flags, some extra constraints are imposed internally:
        i) If the range scan is not pruned to one index fragment then all
           index fragments must be scanned in parallel.  (Non SF_OrderBy* flag
           scans can be executed with lower than full-parallelism)
        ii) Results from every index fragment must be available before returning
            any row, to ensure a correct merge sort.  This serialises the 
            'scrolling' of the scan, potentially resulting in lower row
            throughput.
        iii) Non SF_OrderBy* flag scans can return rows to the Api before all
             index fragments have returned a batch, and can overlap next-batch
             requests with Api row processing.
