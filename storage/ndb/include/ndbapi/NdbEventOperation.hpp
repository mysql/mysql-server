/**
 * @class NdbEventOperation
 * @brief Class of operations for getting change events from database.  
 *
 * Brief description on how to work with events:
 *
 * - An event, represented by an NdbDictionary::Event, i created in the 
 *   Database through
 *   NdbDictionary::Dictionary::createEvent() (note that this can be done 
 *   by any application or thread and not necessarily by the "listener")
 * - To listen to events, an NdbEventOperation object is instantiated by 
 *   Ndb::createEventOperation()
 * - execute() starts the event flow. Use Ndb::pollEvents() to wait
 *   for an event to occur.  Use Ndb::nextEvent() to iterate
 *   through the events that have occurred.
 * - The instance is removed by Ndb::dropEventOperation()
 *
 * For more info see:
 * @ref ndbapi_event.cpp
 *
 * Known limitations:
 *
 * - Maximum number of active NdbEventOperations are now set at compile time.
 * Today 100.  This will become a configuration parameter later.
 * - Maximum number of NdbEventOperations tied to same event are maximum 16
 * per process.
 *
 * Known issues:
 *
 * - When several NdbEventOperation's are tied to the same event in the same
 * process they will share the circular buffer. The BufferLength will then
 * be the same for all and decided by the first NdbEventOperation 
 * instantiation. Just make sure to instantiate the "largest" one first.
 * - Today all events INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE and all changed attributes are
 * sent to the API, even if only specific attributes have been specified.
 * These are however hidden from the user and only relevant data is shown
 * after  Ndb::nextEvent().
 * - "False" exits from Ndb::pollEvents() may occur and thus
 * the subsequent Ndb::nextEvent() will return NULL,
 * since there was no available data. Just do Ndb::pollEvents() again.
 * - Event code does not check table schema version. Make sure to drop events
 * after table is dropped. Will be fixed in later
 * versions.
 * - If a node failure has occurred not all events will be received
 * anymore. Drop NdbEventOperation and Create again after nodes are up
 * again. Will be fixed in later versions.
 *
 * Test status:
 *
 * - Tests have been run on 1-node and 2-node systems
 *
 * Useful API programs:
 *
 * - ndb_select_all -d sys 'NDB$EVENTS_0'
 * shows contents in the system table containing created events.
 *
 * @note this is an interface to viewing events that is subject to change

   *       to allocate enough memory for aValue (if non-NULL).
   *       The buffer aValue supplied by the application must be
   *       aligned appropriately.  The buffer is used directly
   *       (avoiding a copy penalty) only if it is aligned on a

   *       (i.e. NdbRecAttr::attrSize() times NdbRecAttr::arraySize() is
   *       a multiple of 4).
   *
   * @note There are two versions, getValue() and
   *       getPreValue() for retrieving the current and
   *       previous value respectively.
   *
   * @note This method does not fetch the attribute value from 
   *       the database!  The NdbRecAttr object returned by this method 
   *       is <em>not</em> readable/printable before the 
   *       execute() has been made and
   *       Ndb::nextEvent() has returned not NULL.
   *       If a specific attribute has not changed the corresponding 
   *       NdbRecAttr will be in state UNDEFINED.  This is checked by 
   *       NdbRecAttr::isNULL() which then returns -1.
