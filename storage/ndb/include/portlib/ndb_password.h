 *
 * Only printable ASCII are allowed in password.
 *
 * Too long password is not truncated, rather function fails.
 *
 * If input is a terminal and stdout or stderr is also a terminal, prompt will
 * be written to terminal.
 *
 * On success function will return number of characters in password, excluding
 * the terminating NUL character.  buf must have space for size characters
 * including the terminating NUL.
 *
 * On failure it returns a ndb_get_password_error as int.
