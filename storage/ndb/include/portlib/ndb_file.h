/**
 * ndb_file - portable file abstraction for use in NDBFS and NDB BACKUP
 *
 * Note this is not an abstraction for generic file like access.
 *
 * It is assumed that a regular file is accessed by one single process at a
 * time using blocking I/O.
 *
 * For example using this class for named pipes, sockets, or other non regular
 * file like objects may have surprising results.  And the best approach is
 * probably to have specific classes for these usages.
 *
 * Functions used during creation and initialization of a file are broken up
 * in smaller parts even if underlying OS typically can combine several of
 * them in one system call.  This simplifies detection of exactly what failed
 * and simplifies the recovering of failure.  And the number of system calls
 * are typically not important in this case.
 *
 * For read and write operations implicit calls to sync may occur, and since
 * sync failures is not in general guaranteed to be able to retry and ensuring
 * old writes will eventually be synced these failures should be treated as
 * fatal failures for the file and file content should be regarded as
 * inconsistent.
 *
 *
 * A typical life time for a file
 *
 * Initialization phase
 * --------------------
 *
 * create(name) - Note, only creates an empty file, leavs no handle open.
 * open(name, read-write-append flags)
 *
 * extend() or truncate() - Set the initial file size.
 * allocate() - May be used to reserve disk blocks for entire file.
 *
 * set_block_size_and_alignment(size, align)
 * - tells class what size and alignment caller will use on memory blocks to
 *   read and write functions, alignment also restricts the file positions for
 *   read and write.
 *
 * Initialize file by calling append and write functions.
 *
 * set_direct_io()
 * - if by passing OS caching is considered an optimization.
 *   This will also check that block size and alignment requirements for
 *   direct io is satisfied by the block size and alignment set by
 *   application.
 *
 * reopen_with_sync(name)
 * - Turning on sync mode after initialization at least on Linux requires
 *   reopening the file.
 * 
 * set_autosync()
 * - for files not opened in sync mode, make sure to flush out outstanding
 *   writes automatically, not for consistency but to not build up large use
 *   of file buffers while nothing is written to disk.
 *
 * Note, currently one can not open a file in sync mode. A valid encrypted file
 * need both a header and a trailer, keeping a valid trailer updated in append
 * mode will be tricky, it should be possible to do but Ndb does not need that
 * functionality now. For fixed sized files one typically have an
 * initialization phase that does not gain from having each write synced, and
 * using reopen_with_sync() after initialization is good enough for Ndb.
 *
 * Usage phase
 * -----------
 *
 * Calls to append(), write_forward(), write_pos(), read_forward(),
 * read_backward(), read_pos().
 *
 * write_pos() and read_pos() may be called from different threads in parallel.
 *
 * Close and cleanup phase
 * -----------------------
 *
 * sync()
 *
 * close()
 *
 * remove(name)
 *
