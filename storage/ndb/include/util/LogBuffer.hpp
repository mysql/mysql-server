/**
 * Suitable for multiple producers and multiple consumers that are
 * non-blocking, i.e we don't want either of the threads to hang indefinitely.
 *
 * The producer calls append() to put data into the log buffer, while the
 * consumer calls get() to remove data from the log buffer.
 * Appending of both binary data and strings are supported.
 * Appending data of size greater that the log buffer is not possible- the only
 * workarounds are to increase the size of the log buffer or to trim the data
 * to be appended.
 *
 * 1. Appending data to the log buffer is done without hanging(non-blocking),
 *    but there is a possibility of data loss.
 *    Data is appended to the buffer if it *all* fits, otherwise nothing is
 *    appended.
 * 2. Lost data is calculated, and when space for some new entry becomes
 *    available, a 'lost bytes' message is added to the buffer before the new
 *    entry.
 *
 * get() can either be blocking or non-blocking depending on what the user wants.
 * get() blocks for at most 'timeout_ms' when 'timeout_ms' is non-zero
 * and there's no data in the log buffer.
 * get() is non-blocking when 'timeout_ms' is zero.
