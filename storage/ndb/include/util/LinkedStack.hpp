/**
 * LinkedStack
 *
 * A templated class for a stack of elements E.
 * Storage for the elements is allocated using the passed
 * allocator.
 * Push copies the supplied element into the stack
 * Pop overwrites the supplied element with the contents
 * of the top of the stack
 * Internally, the class allocates 'blocks' of elements of
 * the size passed, linking them together as necessary.
 * As the stack shrinks, the blocks are not released.
 * Blocks are returned to the allocator when release() is
 * called.
 * reset() empties the stack without releasing the allocated
 * storage.
