     Opens a gzip (.gz) file for reading or writing. The mode parameter
   is as in fopen ("rb" or "wb") but can also include a compression level
   ("wb9") or a strategy: 'f' for filtered data as in "wb6f", 'h' for
   Huffman only compression as in "wb1h", or 'R' for run-length encoding
   as in "wb1R". (See the description of deflateInit2 for more information
   about the strategy parameter.)

     ndbzopen can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this
   case gzread will directly read from the file without decompression.

     ndbzopen returns NULL if the file could not be opened or if there was
   insufficient memory to allocate the (de)compression state; errno
   can be checked to distinguish the two cases (if errno is zero, the
   zlib error is Z_MEM_ERROR).  */

     ndbzdopen() associates a ndbzio_stream with the file descriptor fd.  File
   descriptors are obtained from calls like open, dup, creat, pipe or
   fileno (in the file has been previously opened with fopen).
   The mode parameter is as in ndbzopen.
     The next call of gzclose on the returned ndbzio_stream will also close the
   file descriptor fd, just like fclose(fdopen(fd), mode) closes the file
   descriptor fd. If you want to keep fd open, use ndbzdopen(dup(fd), mode).
     ndbzdopen returns NULL if there was insufficient memory to allocate
   the (de)compression state.

     If the file is opened for reading, this function is emulated but can be
   extremely slow. If the file is opened for writing, only forward seeks are
   supported; gzseek then compresses a sequence of zeroes up to the new
   starting position.

      gzseek returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from
