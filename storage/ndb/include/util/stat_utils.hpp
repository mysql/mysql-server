/**
 * Provide an implementation of an incremental calculation
 * of means and standard deviation, without storing the
 * entire series of samples. Statistics is calculated over
 * a window of latest n-samples, such that peaks in the stat.
 * will eventually expire, and the stat adjusts to the load
 * as it varies over time.
 *
 * Implementation is loosely based on:
 *   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average
 *   http://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/~fanf2/hermes/doc/antiforgery/stats.pdf
 *
 * A 'simple moving average' is calculated up to the 
 * specified 'sampleSize', short description:
 *
 *   Suppose that the data set is x1, x2,..., xn then for each xn
 *   we can find an updated mean (M) and square of sums (S) as:
 *
 *   M(1) = x(1), M(k) = M(k-1) + (x(k) - M(k-1)) / k
 *   S(1) = 0, S(k) = S(k-1) + (x(k) - M(k-1)) * (x(k) - M(k))
 *
 * When 'sampleSize' has been reached, we transition into
 * calculation an 'exponentially weighted moving average' (EWMA).
 * The existing 'simple moving average' is used as an initial
 * value for the EWMA.
 *
 * The EWMA has the nice property, that the weight for older samples
 * decrease exponentially as they become 'outdated'.
