/*
 * In multithreaded kernel, BlockNumber includes the main block
 * number in lower 9 bits and the instance in upper 7 bits.
 *
 * The new functions that end with Wide support more than 128
 * instances. This is is handled by using a part of the bits
 * in the main part. The main part can be up to 9 bits, so
 * by restricting these to only in reality support 6 bits we
 * free up 3 bits for more instances supported. At the same time
 * we want all the code that is used to handle signals that never
 * goes to higher instance numbers than 128 to not be distracted
 * by this.
 *
 * This is solved by ensuring that we get those 3 bits by some
 * mathematical engineering. This provides backward compatible
 * block references as long as no more than 128 instances are
 * used.
 *
 * If block numbers were starting at 0 and was able to go up to
 * 63 it would be easy enough to simply remove 3 bits from the
 * block number and use those for high instance bits. What we
 * conclude now is that block numbers instead are placed between
 * 244 and 307. To handle this we transform the numbers by
 * adding 512 - 244 and after that do a bitwise AND with 511.
 * This means that 244 to 307 is transformed to 0 to 63. Thus
 * we have then transformed things to where we can simply get
 * the high instance bits by moving them down 6 bits and then
 * multiplying by 128 (by shifting 7 steps to the left).
 *
 * We introduce a unit test to ensure that the calculations
 * are correct.
