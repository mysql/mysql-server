     HOW TO ADD A NEW EVENT
     --------------------
     1) Add SentHeartbeat EventType in the category where it belongs.
        ...
        // INFO
        SentHeartbeat,
        InfoEvent
        ...

     2) remeber to update # of events below. Just to keep count...
        Number of event types = 53

     3) Add a new SentHeartBeat entry to EventLogger::matrix[]. 
       ...
       // INFO
       { EventReport::SentHeartbeat, LogLevel::llInfo, 11, INFO },
       { EventReport::InfoEvent,     LogLevel::llInfo,  2, INFO }      
       ...

     4) Add SentHeartbeat in EventLogger::getText()
