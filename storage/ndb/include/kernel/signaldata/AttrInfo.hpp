/*
  A train of ATTRINFO signals is used to specify attributes to read or
  attributes and values to insert/update in TCKEYREQ, and to specify
  attributes to read in SCAN_TABREQ.

  The ATTRINFO signal train defines a stream of attribute info words.  (Note
  that for TCKEYREQ, the first five words are stored inside the TCKEYREQ
  signal. For SCAN_TABREQ, all attribute info words are sent in ATTRINFO
  signals).

  For SCAN_TABREQ, and TCKEYREQ for read or update with interpreted code, 
  the attribute information can have up to five sections. The initial 
  five words of the stream defines the length of the sections, followed 
  by the words of each section in sequence.

  The sections are:
   1. Attributes to read before starting any interpreted program.
   2. Interpreted program.
   3. Attributes to update after running interpreted program.
   4. Attributes to read after interpreted program.
   5. Subroutine data.

  The formats of sections that specify attributes to read or update is a
  sequence of entries, each (1+N) words:
    1 word specifying the AttributeHeader (attribute id in upper 16 bits, and
           size in bytes of data in lower 16 bits).
    N words of data (N = (data byte length+3)>>2).
  For specifying attributes to read, the data length is always zero.
  For an index range scan of a table using an ordered index, the attribute IDs
  refer to columns in the underlying table, not to columns being indexed, so
  all attributes in the underlying table being indexed are accessible.
