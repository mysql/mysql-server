/**********************  OVERVIEW    ***********************
 *
 * a NdbQuery is created when a NdbQueryDefinition is added to a
 * NdbTransaction for execution with NdbTransaction::creatQuery().
 *
 * A NdbQuery is associated with a collection of NdbQueryOperation which 
 * are instantiated (1::1) to reflect the NdbQueryOperationDef objects
 * which the NdbQueryDef consists of. The same NdbQueryDef may be used to
 * instantiate multiple NdbQuery obejects.
 *
 * When we have an instantiated NdbQuery, we should either bind result buffers
 * for retrieving entire rows from each operation, 
 * (aka NdbRecord interface,::setResultRowRef(), ::setResultRowBuf())
 * or set up retrieval operations for each attribute values, (::getValue()).
 * 
 * Optionally we may also:
 *  - Specify a scan ordering for the result set (parent only)
 *  - Add multiple bounds to a range scan, (::setBound()) (parent only)
 *  - Append a filter condition for each operation (aka mysqlds pushed condition)  
 *
 * The NdbQuery is then executed together with other pending operations 
 * in the next NdbTransaction::execute().
 * The resultset available from a NdbQuery is natively a 'left outer join'
 * between the parent / child operations. If an application is not interested
 * in the 'outer part' of the resultset, it is its own responsibility to
 * filter these rows. Same is valid for any filter condition which has
 * not been appended to the NdbQuery.
 *
 *
 * We provide two different interfaces for iterating the result set:
 *
 * The 'local cursor' (NdbQueryOperation::firstResult(), ::nextResult())
 *   Will navigate the resultset, and fetch results, from this specific operation.
 *   It will only be possible to navigate within those rows which depends
 *   on the current row(s) from any ancestor of the operation.
 *   The local cursor will only retrieve the results, or a NULL row, 
 *   resulting from its own operation. -> All child operations of a 
 *   renavigated local cursor should be navigated to ::firstResult() 
 *   to ensure that they contain results related to the renavigated parent. 
 *   
 * The 'global cursor' (NdbQuery::nextResult())
 *   Will present the result set as a scan on the root operation
 *   with rows from its child operations appearing in an unpredictable 
 *   order. A new set of results, or NULL rows, from *all* operations 
 *   in the query tree are retrieved for each ::nextResult().
 *   NULL rows resulting from the outer joins may appear anywhere 
 *   inside the resultset.
 *
 * As the global cursor is implemented on top of the local cursors, it is
 * possible to mix the usage of global and local cursors.
