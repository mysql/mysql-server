 *  wait for the CONF or REF to be returned. Which also imples that a REF-error
 *  could be received into a scan operation while the client is in the midts
 *  of doing other work, e.g. handling results from other operations in the
 *  same transaction.
 *
 *  To avoid transaction errors appearing 'out of the blue', such asynch
 *  errors are set only on the operation when they are received. Only when
 *  processing the scan results with ::nextResult(), operational errors are
 *  propogated to the transaction level.
