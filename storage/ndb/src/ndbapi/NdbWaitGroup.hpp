/* NdbWaitGroup extends the Asynchronous NDB API, allowing you to wait
   for asynchronous operations to complete on multiple Ndb objects at once.

   All Ndb objects within a poll group must belong to the same cluster
   connection, and only one poll group per cluster connection is currently
   supported.  You instantiate this poll group using
   Ndb_cluster_connection::create_multi_ndb_wait_group().

   Then, after using Ndb::sendPreparedTransactions() to send async operations
   on a particular Ndb object, you can use NdbWaitGroup::addNdb() to add it
   to the group.

   NdbWaitGroup::wait() returns whenever some Ndb's are ready for polling; you can
   then call Ndb::pollNdb(0, 1) on the ones that are ready.
