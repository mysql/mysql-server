/**
  @section ndbPool              Pooling of NDB objects
  This class implements pooling of NDB objects to support MySQL, ODBC and
  any application with a great number of threads.

  The general idea is to let the NdbPool class administer all Ndb objects.
  When a thread needs a Ndb object it request a Ndb object from the Pool.
  This interface contains some hints to ensure that the proper Ndb object
  is returned.

  The object contains an array of references to all Ndb objects together with
  an indication of whether the object is free or not.

  The idea is that the thread should keep track of the Ndb object it used the
  last time. If this object is still free it will simply get this object
  back. If the number of threads do not exceed the number of Ndb objects this
  will always be successful. In certain situations the number of threads will
  be much greater than the number of Ndb objects. In this situation the Pool
  will attempt to provide an object that is attached to the same schema
  as the thread is connected to. If this is not possible it will attempt to
  get any free Ndb object. If not even this is possible the Pool will wait
  until an Ndb object becomes free. If an Ndb object becomes available in
  time it will deliver this Ndb object. In the worst case the call will
  time-out and return NULL to indicate no free Ndb object was found in time.

  The implementation uses an array of structs which contain a reference to a
  Ndb object, whether it is in use currently and a number of references to
  set up linked lists of
  1) Free objects on a schema
  2) Free objects in LIFO order

  Usage:
  The class is a singleton.
  The first step is to call create_instance(..). If successful this will
  create the NdbPool object and return a reference to it. When completed
  drop_instance is called to remove the NdbPool object and all memory and
  other resources attached to it.

  After initialising the NdbPool object all threads can now start using the
  NdbPool. There are two methods in normal usage mode. The first
  get_ndb_object gets a Ndb object and the second return_ndb_object returns
  an Ndb object. The user of the NdbPool must keep track of the identity
  of the Ndb object. The idea is that this identity can also be used to
  find the object quickly again unless another thread have taken it. If the
  user wants any Ndb object it requests identity 0 which means any here.

  When constructing the NdbPool one can set the number of NdbConnection
  objects which are allowed in all Ndb objects. For use in synchronous
  applications such as the MySQL server 4 objects should be enough. When
  using the NdbPool for asynchronous applications one should use 1024 to
  enable a high level of parallelism. It is also possible to set the
  maximum number of Ndb objects in the pool and the initial number of
  Ndb objects allocated.
