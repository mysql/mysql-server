/** 
 *  The SCI Transporter 
 * 
 *  The design goal of the SCI transporter is to deliver high performance  
 *  data transfers (low latency, high bandwidth) combined with very high  
 *  availability (failover support).  
 *  High performance is an inherit feature of SCI and the, whereas failover  
 *  support is implemented at the application level.  
 *  In SCI the programming model is similar to the shared memory paradigm.  
 *  A process on one node (A) allocates a memory segment and import the 
 *  segment to  its virtual address space. Another node (B) can connect to  
 *  the segment and map this segment into its virtual address space.  
 *  If A writes data to the segment, then B can read it and vice versa, through 
 *  ordinary loads and stores. This is also called PIO (programmable IO), and  
 *  is one thing that distinguish SCI from other interconnects such as, 
 *  ethernet, Gig-e, Myrinet, and Infiniband. By using PIO, lower network  
 *  latency is achieved, compared to the interconnects mentioned above. 
 *  In order for NDB to utilize SCI,  the SCI transporter relies on the  
 *  SISCI api. The SISCI api provides a high level abstraction to the low 
 *  level SCI driver called PCISCI driver. 
 *  The SISCI api provides functions to setup, export, and import 
 *  memory segments in a process virtual address space, and also functions to 
 *  guarantee the correctness of data transfers between nodes. Basically, the  
 *  
 *  In NDB Cluster, each SCI transporter creates a local segment  
 *  that is mapped into the virtual address space. After the creation of the  
 *  local segment, the SCI transporter connects to a segment created by another 
 *  transporter at a remote node, and the maps the remote segment into its  
 *  virtual address space. However, since NDB Cluster relies on redundancy 
 *  at the network level, by using dual SCI adapters communication can be
 *  maintained even if one of the adapter cards fails (or anything on the
 *  network this adapter card exists in e.g. an SCI switch failure).
