/*
 * JTie pre-defines type mappings for the C99 exact-width type aliases
 *   int8_t, uint8_t, int16_t, uint16_t, int32_t, uint32_t, int64_t, uint64_t
 * as defined in <stdint.h> as well as uses these types internally.
 *
 * Unfortunately, some C/C++ compiler still lack a stdint.h header file.
 * (For instance, MS Visual Studio until VS2010.)  We delegate to a helper
 * file that handles the absence of the <stdint.h>.
 *
 * Applications of JTie (like NDB JTie) may define their own type aliases
 * for exact-width types (like Uint8, Int8 etc), for which type mappings can
 * be easily provided with just a few (NDB) JTie (_trait alias) definitions.
 *
 * Here, we do NOT want to introduce artificial dependencies by referring to
 * application-specific aliases for JTie's generic implementation and tests:
 * compiler/platform testing has proven (!) much easier when the JTie core
 * code is self-contained and the JTie unit tests compile & run standalone.
