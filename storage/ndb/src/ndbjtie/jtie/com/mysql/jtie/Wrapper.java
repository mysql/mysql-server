/**
 * A base class for Java peer classes representing a C/C++ object type.
 *
 * This class declares only non-public members, which enable the JTie
 * runtime to map a Java </code>Wrapper</code> instance to a C/C++ object.
 * 
 * A Java peer class extending </code>Wrapper</code>
 * <ol>
 * <li> must provide a no-arg constructor (may be of any access modifier,
 *      but preferred private),
 * <li> will declare a native method for each C/C++ (member and non-member)
 *      function to be mapped to Java, and
 * <li> ought not to have any non-static fields (i.e., state by its own).
 * </ol>
 *
 * Please, note that JTie provides no guarantees on the association between
 * </code>Wrapper</code> instances and their underlying C/C++ objects.
 * In particular,
 * <ol>
 * <li> multiple </code>Wrapper</code> instances may exist for the same
 *      C/C++ object at any time and
 * <li> a C/C++ object may have been deleted by the application while
 *      corresponding Java </code>Wrapper</code> instances still exist
 *      (i.e., referential integrity cannot be assumed).
 * </ol>
