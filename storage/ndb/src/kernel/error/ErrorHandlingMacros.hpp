        // Description:
        //      Call ErrorHandler with the supplied arguments. The
        //      ErrorHandler decides how to report the error.
        // Parameters:
        //      messageID       IN      Code identifying the error. If less
        //                              than 1000 a unix error is assumed. If
        //                              greater than 1000 the code is treated 
        //                              as the specific problem code.
        //      problemData     IN      A (short) text describing the error.
        //                              The context information is added to
        //                              this text.
        //      objectRef       IN      The name of the "victim" of the error.
        //                              Specify NULL if not applicable.
        // Return value:
        //      -
        // Reported errors:
        //      -
