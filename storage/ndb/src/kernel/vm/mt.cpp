/**
 * There are some send scheduling algorithms build into the send thread.
 * Mainly implemented as part of ::run_send_thread, thus commented here:
 *
 * We have the possibility to set a 'send delay' for each trp. This
 * is used both for handling send overload where we should wait
 * before retrying, and as an aid for collecting smaller packets into
 * larger, and thus fewer packets. Thus decreasing the send overhead
 * on a highly loaded system.
 *
 * A delay due to overload is always waited for. As there are already
 * queued up send work in the buffers, sending will be possible
 * without the send thread actively busy-retrying. However, delays
 * in order to increase the packed size can be ignored.
 *
 * The basic idea if the later is the following:
 * By introducing a delay we ensure that all block threads have
 * gotten a chance to execute messages that will generate data
 * to be sent to trps. This is particularly helpful in e.g.
 * queries that are scanning a table. Here a SCAN_TABREQ is
 * received in a TC and this generates a number of SCAN_FRAGREQ
 * signals to each LDM, each of those LDMs will in turn generate
 * a number of new signals that are all destined to the same
 * trp. So this delay here increases the chance that those
 * signals can be sent in the same TCP/IP packet over the wire.
 *
 * Another use case is applications using the asynchronous API
 * and thus sending many PK lookups that traverse a trp in
 * parallel from the same destination trp. These can benefit
 * greatly from this extra delay increasing the packet sizes.
 *
 * There is also a case when sending many updates that need to
 * be sent to the other trp in the same node group. By delaying
 * the send of this data we ensure that the receiver thread on
 * the other end is getting larger packet sizes and thus we
 * improve the throughput of the system in all sorts of ways.
 *
 * However we also try to ensure that we don't delay signals in
 * an idle system where response time is more important than
 * the throughput. This is achieved by the fact that we will
 * send after looping through the trps ready to send to. In
 * an idle system this will be a quick operation. In a loaded
 * system this delay can be fairly substantial on the other
 * hand.
 *
 * Finally we attempt to limit the use of more than one send
 * thread to cases of very high load. So if there are only
 * delayed trp sends remaining, we deduce that the
 * system is lightly loaded and we will go to sleep if there
 * are other send threads also awake.

/**
 * FUNCTION: scan_time_queues(), scan_time_queues_impl(),
 *           scan_time_queues_backtick()
 *
 * scan_time_queues() Implements the part we want to be inlined
 * into the scheduler loops, while *_impl() & *_backtick() is
 * the more unlikely part we don't call unless the timer has
 * ticked backward or forward more than 1ms since last 'scan_time.
 *
 * Check if any delayed signals has expired and should be sent now.
 * The time_queues will be checked every time we detect a change
 * in current time of >= 1ms. If idle we will sleep for max 10ms
 * before rechecking the time_queue.
 *
 * However, some situations need special attention:
 * - Even if we prefer monotonic timers, they are not available, or
 *   implemented in our abstraction layer, for all platforms.
 *   A non-monotonic timer may leap when adjusted by the user, both
 *   forward or backwards.
 * - Early implementation of monotonic timers had bugs where time
 *   could jump. Similar problems has been reported for several VMs.
 * - There might be CPU contention or system swapping where we might
 *   sleep for significantly longer that 10ms, causing long forward
 *   leaps in perceived time.
 *
 * In order to adapt to this non-perfect clock behaviour, the
 * scheduler has its own 'm_ticks' which is the current time
 * as perceived by the scheduler. On entering this function, 'now'
 * is the 'real' current time fetched from NdbTick_getCurrentTime().
 * 'selfptr->m_ticks' is the previous tick seen by the scheduler,
 * and as such is the timestamp which reflects the current time
 * as seen by the timer queues.
 *
 * Normally only a few milliseconds will elapse between each ticks
 * as seen by the diff between 'now' and 'selfthr->m_ticks'.
 * However, if there are larger leaps in the current time,
 * we breaks this up in several small(20ms) steps
 * by gradually increasing schedulers 'm_ticks' time. This ensure
 * that delayed signals will arrive in correct relative order,
 * and repeated signals (pace signals) are received with
 * the expected frequence. However, each individual signal may
 * be delayed or arriving to fast. Where excact timing is critical,
 * these signals should do their own time calculation by reading
 * the clock, instead of trusting that the signal is delivered as
 * specified by the 'delay' argument
 *
 * If there are leaps larger than 1500ms, we try a hybrid
 * solution by moving the 'm_ticks' forward, close to the
 * actuall current time, then continue as above from that
 * point in time. A 'time leap Warning' will also be printed
 * in the logs.

 *
 * If MUST_SEND is true, we still only try to lock, but if it would block,
 * we will force the thread holding the lock, to do the sending on our behalf.
 *
 * The list of pending trps to send to is thread-local, but the per-trp send
 * buffer is shared by all threads. Thus we might skip a trp for which
 * another thread has pending send data, and we might send pending data also
 * for another thread without clearing the trp from the pending list of that
 * other thread (but we will never loose signals due to this).
 *
 * Return number of trps which still has pending data to be sent.
 * These will be retried again in the next round. 'Pending' is
 * returned as a negative number if nothing was sent in this round.
 *
 * (Likely due to receivers consuming too slow, and receive and send buffers
 *  already being filled up)
 *
 * Sending data to other trps is a task that we perform using an algorithm
 * that depends on the state of block threads. The block threads can be in
 * 3 different states:
 *
 * LIGHT_LOAD:
 * -----------
 * In this state we will send to all trps we generate data for. In addition
 * we will also send to one trp if we are going to sleep, we will stay awake
 * until no more trps to send to. However between each send we will also
 * ensure that we execute any signals destined for us.
 *
 * LIGHT_LOAD threads can also be provided to other threads as wakeup targets.
 * This means that these threads will be woken up regularly under load to
 * assist with sending.
 *
 * MEDIUM_LOAD:
 * ------------
 * At this load level we will also assist send threads before going to sleep
 * and continue so until we have work ourselves to do or until there are no
 * more trps to send to. We will additionally send partially our own data.
 * We will also wake up a send thread during send to ensure that sends are
 * performed ASAP.
 *
 * OVERLOAD:
 * ---------
 * At this level we will simply inform the send threads about the trps we
 * sent some data to, the actual sending will be handled by send threads
 * and other block threads assisting the send threads.
 *
 * In addition if any thread is at overload level we will sleep for a shorter
 * time.
 *
 * The decision about which idle threads to wake up, which overload level to
 * use and when to sleep for shorter time is all taken by the local THRMAN
 * block. Some decisions is also taken by the THRMAN instance in the main
 * thread.
 *
 * Send threads are woken up in a round robin fashion, each time they are
 * awoken they will continue executing until no more work is around.

 * The decision to send/flush is determined by config parameters that

   * At this point in time we need to check congestion, we have inserted
   * a signal into the job buffer. This could potentially create a situation
   * where a congestion have occurred. Setting congestion states is handled
   * entirely from here. Resetting those states is entirely by the threads
   * after executing a set of signals.
   *
   * We use two congestion levels. The first levels stops execution of signals
   * in most threads. Only congested threads are allowed to continue executing.
   * The second level of congestion will also stop receive threads from
   * inserting signals into the job buffers.
   *
   * The reason for continuing to receive signals even as we reach the first
   * congestion level is to be able to handle higher priority level signals
   * as much as possible. We will also avoid stopping the main thread until
   * we block the receive threads from progressing.
   *
   * So there are a number of job buffer levels:
   * CAN_EXECUTE: This level is around 1 MByte, threads having more than this
   *   level is allowed to continue executing until we reach the second
   *   congestion level.
   * LEVEL_1_CONGESTION: This level is around 16 Mbytes and when any thread
   *   has reached this level it will ensure that all threads that are not in
   *   CAN_EXECUTE level will be held off from executing. Threads that are in
   *   LEVEL_1_CONGESTION will be allowed to execute even when any thread are
   *   LEVEL_2_CONGESTION.
   * LEVEL_2_CONGESTION: This level is around 20 MBytes and when this level is
   *   reached we will no longer receive from receive threads and no longer
   *   execute from threads in CAN_EXECUTE mode.
   *
   * The job buffer can contain up to 32 MBytes of signal data.
   *
   * The owner of the m_write_lock can change the state a thread is in
   * upwards. The thread itself can decrease the congestion state of a thread
   * is in when holding this mutex.
   *
   * Whenever a thread goes up to LEVEL_1_CONGESTION an atomic counter will
   * be increased, similarly when it drops below LEVEL_1_CONGESTION the same
   * atomic counter will be decreased. So this atomic variable being larger
   * than 0 means that any thread is in LEVEL_1_CONGESTION state.
   *
   * There is a similar atomic variable for LEVEL_2_CONGESTION.
   *
   * We optimise this function by using the cached_read_index first. If there
   * is no congestion with the cached read index, then there is certainly no
   * congestion on the real m_read_index since the cached_read_index is always
   * going to show a smaller free level.
   *
   * If there isn't enough space according to the cached read index, we read
   * the real m_read_index and at the same time we move the cached_read_index
   * forward to ensure it is kept as much up to date as possible.
   *
   * This means that we often manage to avoid reading the m_read_index which
   * is very often going to be a cache miss since it is updated by the
   * executing thread very often.

 * the crash handling.
 *
 * To avoid this we use this function that only is useful in ndbmtd where
 * we check if the crash handling has already started. We protect this
 * check using the stop_for_crash-mutex. This function is called twice,
 * first to write an entry in the error log and second to specify that the
 * error log write is completed.
 *
 * We proceed only from the first call if the crash handling hasn't started
 * or if the crash is not caused by an error insert. If it is caused by an
 * error insert it is a normal situation with multiple crashes, so we won't
 * clutter the error log with multiple entries in this case. If it is a real
 * crash and we have more than one thread crashing, then this is vital
 * information to write in the error log, we do however not want more than
 * one set of trace files.
 *
 * To ensure that writes of the error log happens for one thread at a time we
 * protect it with the stop_for_crash-mutex. We hold this mutex between the
 * first and second call of this function from the error reporter thread.
 *
 * We proceed from the first call only if we are the first thread that
 * reported an error. To handle this properly we start by acquiring the
 * mutex, then we write the error log, when we come back we set the
 * crash_started flag and release the mutex to enable other threads to
 * write into the error log, but still stopping them from proceeding to
 * write another set of trace files.
 *
 * We will not come back from this function the second time unless we are
 * the first crashing thread.
