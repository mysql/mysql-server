/**
 * LocalSegmentList
 *
 * Util class for working with Segment List
 *
 * Segments from the global segment pool can be linked in a list - this
 * is heavily used for passing 'long sections' around within a data node
 * without copying.
 *
 * Segments internally have 4 words of header data, and 60 words of payload
 * The header data includes a size in words, a next ptr, a prev ptr and an
 * ownerRef
 *
 * Typically the existing 'long signal' code uses the size member of the first
 * segment in the list as the valid size in words of the whole list.
 * The next pointer is used, but the prev pointer and m_ownerRef are not.
 *
 * Sections (segment lists) are typically built up over time, and then freed
 * at one time.
 *
 * The underlying Segments support more flexible usage, e.g. as a FIFO, or
 * Stack or double-ended list.  This class aims to support that usage, in
 * a clean-ish way so that it is easy to use.
 *
 * Initially, support for using a Segment List as a FIFO is implemented -
 * words can be 'enqueued' at the tail of a 'word list' and 'dequeued' from
 * the head.  The tail is the end of a segment list (long section), and the
 * head is the start of the list...  The m_ownerRef value in the first section's
 * header is used as an offset within that section to the head of the word list.
 *
 * This can be extended over time with :
 *   enqWordsAtHead()
 *     Can be O(1) with just nextPtrs...
 *
 *   deqWordsFromTail()
 *     Requires setting of prevPtrs when building list...
 *
 * A 'normal' long section IValue can be used as the head of a list, as long
 * as it's m_ownerRef is set to 0 initially (should be the case).
 * A list can be treated as a long section, as the size value includes the valid
 * data and the offset.
 *
 * The complexities of per-thread segment caches are hidden using the SegmentUtils
 * abstraction.
