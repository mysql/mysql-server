/*
 * Recursive mutex with recursion limit >= 1.  Intended for debugging.
 * One should rewrite caller code until limit 1 works.
 *
 * The implementation uses a default mutex.  If limit is > 1 or debug
 * is specified then a recursive mutex is simulated.  Operating system
 * recursive mutex (if any) is not used.  The simulation is several
 * times slower.  There is a unit test testSafeMutex.
 *
 * The caller currently is multi-threaded disk data.  Here it is easy
 * to verify that the mutex is released within a time-slice.
