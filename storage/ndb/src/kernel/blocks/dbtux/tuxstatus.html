<h2>NDB Ordered Index Status</h2>
<p>
<h3>Alpha release Jan 30, 2004</h3> 
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Up to 32 index attributes of any type, possibly nullable.
  <li>
  Index build i.e. table need not be empty.
  <li>
  Logging NOT done, index rebuilt at system restart.
  <li>
  Single range scan with lower and upper bounds.
  <li>
  Scan with locking: read latest, read for update.
  <li>
  LIMITED number of parallel scans.
  <li>
  Total result set NOT in index key order.
  <li>
  NDB ODBC optimizer to use ordered index for equality but NOT for ranges.
  <li>
  MySQL optimizer to use ordered index for equality and ranges.
</ul>
<p>
As an example, consider following index on integer attributes.
<p>
<tt>SQL&gt;create index X on T (A, B, C) nologging;</tt>
<p>
Single range scan means that bounds are set on
an initial sequence of index keys, and all but last is an equality.
<br>
For example following scans are supported (the last 2 not via NDB ODBC).
<p>
<tt>SQL&gt;select * from T where A = 1;</tt>
<br>
<tt>SQL&gt;select * from T where A = 1 and B = 10 and C = 20;</tt>
<br>
<tt>SQL&gt;select * from T where A &lt; 10;</tt>
<br>
<tt>SQL&gt;select * from T where A = 1 and 10 &lt; B and B &lt; 20;</tt>
<p>
Following scans are NOT supported:
<p>
<tt>SQL&gt;select * from T where B = 1;</tt>
<br>
<tt>SQL&gt;select * from T where A &lt; 10 and B &lt; 20;</tt>

</table>
<p>
1) No locking and bounds must be on non-nullable key attributes.
<br>
2) Currently table must be empty when index is created.
<br>
3) Currently limited to 11 simultaneous per fragment.
