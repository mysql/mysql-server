 * Start a scan of a page in LCP scan
 * ----------------------------------
 * We have seven options here for LCP scans:
 * 1) The page entry is empty and was empty at start of
 * LCP. In this case there is no flag set in the page
 * map indicating that page was dropped since last it
 * was dropped.
 * 1a) The page was belonging to the CHANGED ROWS pages and the
 * last LCP state was A. In this case we need to record a
 * DELETE by PAGEID in the LCP.
 *
 * 1b) The page belonged to the CHANGED ROWS pages and the last
 * LCP state was D. In this case we can ignore the page.
 *
 * 1c) The page was belonging to the ALL ROWS category.
 * We can ignore it since we only record rows existing at start of
 * the LCP.
 * Then we continue with the next page.
 *
 * 2) The page entry is empty and it was recorded as being
 * dropped since the LCP started. In this case the LCP scan
 * have already taken care of this page, the needed information
 * was sent to the LCP scan through the LCP keep list.
 * 3) The page entry was not empty but the page map indicates
 * that the page was dropped after the LCP scan started. In this
 * tricky case the LCP scan started, the page was dropped, the
 * page was resurrected again and finally now we come here to
 * handle the page. Again in this case we can move on since the
 * page was handled at the time the page was dropped.
 *
 * 2) and 3) are found through either the LCP_SCANNED_BIT being
 * set in the page map, or by the page_to_skip_lcp bit being set
 * on the page object.
 *
 * 4) The page entry is non-empty. This is the normal page
 * handling where we scan one row at a time.
 *
 * Finally the case 4) can have four distinct options as well.
 * 4a) The page existed before the LCP started and had rows
 * in it that need to checked one by one. This is the normal
 * case and by far the most commonly executed.
 *
 * 4b) The page did not exist before the LCP scan was started, but
 * it was allocated after the LCP scan started and before we scanned
 * it (thus got the LCP skip bit set on the page). It belonged to
 * the ALL ROWS pages and thus the page will be skipped.
 *
 * Discovered either by LCP_SCANNED_BIT or by page_to_skip_lcp bit
 * being set on the page.
 *
 * 4c) Same as 4b) except that it belongs to the CHANGED ROWS pages.
 * Also the last LCP state was D. Page is ignored.
 *
 * 4d) Same as 4c) except that last LCP state was A. In this we
 * record the page as a DELETE by PAGEID in the LCP.

       * while an LCP is ongoing. During normal traffic operations
       * this means that the GCI is set to the GCI of the transaction.
       * The only other case where we can set LCP_SKIP is when a
       * DELETE operation arrives as part of COPY FRAG from live node
       * to starting node.
       *
       * In this case the GCI is set to the same GCI that the row in
       * the starting node have. If the GCI on the starting node is
       * not 0, then the GCI is always bigger than the GCI we are
       * storing locally, so we won't arrive in this path.
       *
       * There is however a case where the GCI is 0 in the live node.
       * This happens when the row has the state FREE_RECORD. This
       * means that the row is in a new page and the row hasn't been
       * used yet.
       * In this case we need to copy the row over to the starting node
       * to ensure that the row is deleted if it exists on the starting
       * node.
       *
       * If there is a row in this position AND a local LCP is ongoing,
       * in this case we could set the LCP_SKIP flag although the GCI
       * is set to 0.
       *
       * This case will only happen under the following condition.
       * 1) A row must have existed in this rowid before the starting node
       * stopped and is thus restored in the RESTORE, REBUILD, execute
       * REDO phase.
       * 2) The row must have been deleted together with all other rows
       *    in the same page such that the page of the row is dropped.
       * 3) At least one row in this page must have been inserted again,
       *    but the row in question must still be empty in the live node.
       * 4) A local LCP must be ongoing while COPY FRAGMENT of this
       *    fragment is ongoing, this can only happen if we start a
       *    full local LCP during COPY FRAGMENT. This in turn can only
       *    happen if the UNDO log for disk data parts is filled to the
       *    extent that we must ensure that an LCP is completed before
       *    the COPY FRAGMENT is completed.
       *

 /**
 * LCP scanning of CHANGE ROW pages:
 * ---------------------------------
 * The below description is implemented by the setup_change_page_for_scan and
 * handle_scan_change_page_rows methods.
 *
 * When scanning changed pages we only need to record those rows that actually
 * changed. There are two things that we need to ensure here. The first is
 * that we need to ensure that we restore the correct data. The second is that
 * we ensure that each checkpoint maintains structural consistency.
 *
 * To prove that we will restore the correct data we notice that the last
 * change to restore is in a previous checkpoint.
 *
 * In the previous checkpoint we wrote all rows that changed in the first GCI
 * that wasn't completed before we started the GCI or in any later GCI.
 * From this follows that we will definitely have written all changes since
 * the last checkpoint and even more than that.
 *
 * Given that we restore using multiple LCPs there could be a risk that we cut
 * away the LCP part where the changed row was recorded. This is not possible
 * for the following reason:
 * Restore of a page always start at a LCP where the page was fully written.
 * If this happened after the change we know that the record is there.
 * If the change happened after the LCP where ALL changes were recorded we
 * know that the LCP part is part of the restore AND we know that our change is
 * in this LCP part.
 *
 * From this it follows that we will restore the correct data since no changes
 * will be missing from the restored data.
 *
 * Next we need to verify that maintain structural consistency.This means that
 * we must restore exactly the set of rows that was present at the start of
 * the LCP that we are restoring.
 *
 * To maintain this we need to ensure that any INSERTs that happened after
 * start of the previous LCP but before we scanned this row is not missed due
 * to that no changes occurred in this page since we last scanned it. To ensure
 * that we don't miss those rows we will notice that those rows will always
 * be marked with an LCP_DELETE flag for CHANGE pages. This means that when we
 * encounter a row with this flag we need to set the bit in the change map to
 * ensure that this row is recorded in the next LCP.
 *
 * Next we need to handle DELETEs that occur after the LCP started but before
 * we scanned the page. All these rows have the LCP_SKIP bit set. This means
 * that when we encounter the LCP_SKIP for CHANGE pages we should ensure that
 * the row is checked also in the next LCP by setting the change map to
 * indicate this.
 *
 * Finally if there are so many deletes that the state on the page is deleted
 * since the page is dropped, this we need not worry about since this is
 * handled in the same manner as the original partial LCP solution. So the
 * proof of this applies.
 *
 * Finally UPDATEs that occur after the LCP start but before we scan the row
 * will be recorded in the previous LCP and will not require setting any bits
 * in the change map. This is in line with normal behaviour of the LCPs, the
 * LCP is structurally consistent with the start of the LCP (the exact same
 * set of rows exists that existed at start of LCP). The data is however not
 * necessarily consistent since we rely o* the REDO log to bring data
 * consistency.
 *
 * The major benefit of these change map pages comes when an entire page can
 * be skipped. In this case we can change scanning hundreds of rows to a
 * simple check of a small bitmap on the page. To handle very large databases
 * well we implement the bitmaps using a sort of BLOOM filter.
 *
 * We have 8 bits that indicate changes in 4 kB of the page. If this bit isn't
 * set we can skip an entire 4 kB part of page that could easily contain up to
 * a bit more than * one hundred rows.
 *
 * Finally we have a bitmap consisting of 128 bits that each means we can skip
 * 256 bytes at a time when a bit isn't set.
 *
 * One problem with scanning using those bitmaps is that there is a cost
 * attached to skipping rows since it is harder to prefetch data. Thus we will
 * ignore the small area change bitmap when we have enough bits set and simply
 * scan all rows, we will still check the large area change bitmap though
 * also in this case.
 *
 * One special case we need to be careful with is when a new page has been
 * allocated. If this new page is reusing a previously used page slot and
 * thus reusing row ids we need to ensure that we scan the entire page.
 * This is required to generate DELETE BY ROWID for all row ids not yet
 * inserted into (there could be old inserts into these row ids in older
 * LCP data files, so important to remove those to get a consistent LCP.
 * We solve this by always ensuring that we scan the page the first time
 * by setting all bits in the change map and thus ensuring that the
 * m_all_rows is set to true while scanning the page. We could be more
 * elaborate and only set it on pages that reuse a page slot or we could
 * even use a bit in the tuple header for it. But this method should be
 * good enough for now.

/**
 * Handling heavy insert and delete activity during LCP scans
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * As part of the LCP we need to record all rows that existed at the beginning
 * of the LCP. This means that any rows that are inserted after the LCP
 * started can be skipped. This is a common activity during database load
 * activity, so we ensure that the LCP can run quick in this case to provide
 * much CPU resources for the insert activity. Also important to make good
 * progress on LCPs to ensure that we can free REDO log space to avoid running
 * out of this resource.
 *
 * We use three ways to signal that a row or a set of rows is not needed to
 * record during an LCP.
 *
 * 1) We record the maximum page number at the start of the LCP, we never
 *    need to scan beyond this point, there can only be pages here that
 *    won't need recording in an LCP. We also avoid setting LCP_SKIP bits
 *    on these pages and rows.
 *    This will cover the common case of a small set of pages at the
 *    start of the LCP that grows quickly during the LCP scan.
 *
 * 2) If a page was allocated after the LCP started, then it can only contain
 *    rows that won't need recording in the LCP. If the page number was
 *    within the maximum page number at start of LCP, and beyond the page
 *    currently checked in LCP, then we will record the LCP skip information
 *    in the page header. So when the LCP scan reaches this page it will
 *    quickly move on to the next page since the page didn't have any records
 *    eligible for LCP recording. After skipping the page we clear the LCP
 *    skip flag since the rows should be recorded in the next LCP.
 *
 * 3) In case a row is allocated in a page that existed at start of LCP, then
 *    we record the LCP skip information in the tuple header unless the row
 *    has already been checked by the current LCP. We skip all rows with this
 *    bit set and reset it to ensure that we record it in the next LCP.

               * part of long transactions.
               *
               * The final problem is when the INSERT is aborted. In this case

 * The LCP requires that some rows which are deleted during the main-memory

 * find the disk-data part again, so that it can be deleted during Redo
 * application.
 *
 * This is implemented by copying the row content into
 * 'undo memory' / copy tuple space, and adding it to a per-fragment
 * 'lcp keep list', before deleting it at transaction commit time.
 * The row content is then only reachable via the lcp keep list, and does not
 * cause any ROWID reuse issues (899).
 *
 * The LCP scan treats the fragment's 'lcp keep list' as a top-priority source
 * of rows to be included in the fragment LCP, so rows should only be kept
 * momentarily.

 * As these rows exist solely in DBTUP undo memory, it is not necessary to
 * perform the normal ACC locking protocols etc, but it is necessary to prepare
 * TUP for the coming TUPKEYREQ...
 *
 * The principle behind the LCP keep list is described in more detail in
 * the research paper:
 * Recovery Principles of MySQL Cluster 5.1 presented at VLDB in 2005.
 * The main thought is that we restore the disk data part to the point in time
 * when we start the LCP on the fragment. Thus we need to ensure that any rows
 * that exist at start of LCP also exist in the LCP and vice versa any row
 * that didn't exist at start of LCP doesn't exist in LCP. Updates of rows
 * don't matter since the REDO log application will ensure that the row
 * gets synchronized.
 *
 * An important part of this is to record the number of pages at start of LCP.
 * We don't need to worry about scanning pages deleted during LCP since the
 * LCP keep list ensures that those rows were checkpointed before being
 * deleted.

   * the LCP. The rows that was deleted after LCP start have already
   * been handled. Those that have been handled have got the LCP_SKIP
   * bit set in the tuple header. Those not handled we need to check
   * the Row GCI to see if it is either 0 or >= scanGCI. If so then
   * we need to record them as part of LCP.
   *
   * We store all the rowid's we find to record as DELETE by ROWID in
   * in a local data array on the stack before we start writing them
   * into the LCP keep list.
   *
   * The page itself that we are scanning will be returned to the same
   * memory pool as we are allocating copy tuples from. So after
   * scanning the page we will do the following:
   * 1) Acquire a global lock on the NDB memory manager to ensure that
   *    no other thread is allowed to snatch the page from us until
   *    we are sure that we got what we needed.
   * 2) Release the page with the lock held
   * 3) Acquire the needed set of copy tuples (called with a lock flag
   *    set).
   * 4) Release the lock on the NDB memory manager
   *
   * This procedure will guarantee that we have space to record the
   * DELETE by ROWIDs in the LCP keep list.
   *
   * An especially complex case happens when the LCP scan is in the
   * middle of scanning this page. This could happen due to an
   * inopportune real-time break in combination with multiple
   * deletes happening within this real-time break.
   *
   * If page_to_skip_lcp bit was set we will perform delete_by_pageid
   * here. So we need not worry about this flag in call to
   * is_rowid_in_remaining_lcp_set for each row in loop, this call will
   * ensure that we will skip any rows already handled by the LCP scan.
