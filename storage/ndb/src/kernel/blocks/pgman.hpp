/*
 * PGMAN
 *
 * PAGE ENTRIES AND REQUESTS
 *
 * Central structure is "page entry".  It corresponds to a disk page
 * identified by file and page number (file_no, page_no).
 *
 * A page entry is created by first request for the disk page.
 * Subsequent requests are queued under the same page entry.
 *
 * There is a limited number of in-memory "cache pages", also called
 * "buffer pages" or "real pages".  These are used by the more numerous
 * page entries to buffer the disk pages.
 *
 * A new or non-resident page entry must first be "bound" to an
 * available cache page.  Next the disk page must be "mapped" to the
 * cache page.  If the page is empty (never written) it is considered
 * mapped trivially.  Otherwise the cache page must be updated via
 * "pagein" from disk.  A bound and mapped page is called "resident".
 *
 * Updating a resident cache page makes it "dirty".  A background
 * clean-up process makes dirty pages "clean" via "pageout" to disk.
 * Write ahead logging (WAL) of the page is done first i.e. UNDO log is
 * flushed up to the page log sequence number (LSN) by calling a LGMAN
 * method.  The reason for this is obvious but not relevant to PGMAN.
 *
 * A local check point (LCP) periodically performs a complete pageout of
 * dirty pages.  It must iterate over a list which will cover all pages
 * which had been dirty since LCP start.
 *
 * A clean page is a candidate ("victim") for being "unmapped" and
 * "evicted" from the cache, to allow another page to become resident.
 * This process is called "page replacement".
 *
 * PAGE REPLACEMENT
 *
 * Page replacement uses the LIRS algorithm (Jiang-Zhang).
 * 
 * The "recency" of a page is the time between now and the last request
 * for the page.  The "inter-reference recency" (IRR) of a page is the
 * time between the last 2 requests for the page.  "Time" is advanced by
 * request for any page.
 *
 * Page entries are divided into "hot" ("lir") and "cold" ("hir").  Here
 * lir/hir refers to low/high IRR.  Hot pages are always resident but
 * cold pages need not be.
 *
 * Number of hot pages is limited to slightly less than number of cache
 * pages.  Until this number is reached, all used cache pages are hot.
 * Then the algorithm described next is applied.  The algorithm avoids
 * storing any of the actual recency values.
 *
 * Primary data structure is the "stack".  It contains all hot entries
 * and recently referenced cold entries (resident or not).  The stack is
 * in recency order with most recent (lowest recency) entry on top.
 * Entries which are less recent than the least recent hot page are
 * removed ("stack pruning").  So the bottom page is always hot.
 *
 * The cold entries on the stack are undergoing a "trial period".  If
 * they are referenced soon again (see IRR), they become hot.  Otherwise
 * they fall off the bottom of the stack.
 *
 * Secondary data structure is the "queue".  It contains all resident
 * cold pages (on stack or not).  When a hot page is removed from the
 * stack it is added to the end of the queue.  When page replacement
 * needs a page it removes it from the front of the queue.
 *
 * Page requests cause the input entry to be inserted and updated in
 * LIRS lists.  Remember that an entry can be present on both stack and
 * queue.  The rules per type of input entry are:
 *
 * 1. Hot.  Move input entry to stack top.  If input entry was at stack
 * bottom, do stack pruning.
 *
 * 2. Cold resident.  Move input entry to stack top.  Then:
 *
 * 2a. If input entry was on stack, change it to hot, remove it from
 * queue, change stack bottom entry to cold and move the bottom entry to
 * queue end, and do stack pruning.
 *
 * 2b. If input entry was on queue only, leave it cold but move it to
 * end of queue.
 *
 * 3. Cold non-resident.  Remove entry at queue front and evict it from
 * the cache.  If the evicted entry was on stack, it remains as unbound
 * entry on stack, to continue its trial period.  Map input entry to the
 * freed cache page.  Move input entry to stack top.  Then:
 *
 * 3a. If input entry was on stack, change it to hot, change stack
 * bottom entry to cold and move the bottom entry to queue end, and do
 * stack pruning.
 *
 * 3b. If input entry was new, leave it cold but move it to end of
 * queue.
 *
 * LIRS CHANGES
 *
 * In LIRS the 'resident' requirement is changed as follows:
 *
 * Stack entries, including hot ones, can have any state.  Unbound stack
 * entries are created by new requests and by pages evicted from queue
 * front which are still on stack.
 *
 * Queue entries must be bound.  They become resident and evictable
 * within a finite time.  A page is "evictable" if it is mapped, clean,
 * and has no requests.
 *
 * An unbound entry which should be on queue is added there at bind
 * time.  Such entries are created when an unbound entry with open
 * requests is popped (hot) or pruned (cold) from the stack.  This can
 * happen if the cache is too small.
 *
 * CLEANUP PROCESS
 *
 * LIRS (and related algorithms) do not address dirty pages.  From above
 * it is obvious that the clean-up process should process dirty queue
 * entries proceeding from front to end.  This also favors pages with
 * lower LSN numbers which minimizes amount of WAL to write.
 *
 * In fact the clean-up process holds a permanent pointer into the queue
 * where all entries strictly towards the front are clean.  For such an
 * entry to become dirty it must be referenced again which moves it to
 * queue end and past the clean-up pointer.  (In practice, until this
 * works, cleanup recycles back to queue front).
 *
 * PAGE LISTS
 *
 * Page entries are put on a number of lists.
 *
 * 1. Hash table on (file_no, page_no).  Used for fast lookup and for
 * LCP to iterate over.
 *
 * The other lists are doubly-linked FIFOs.  In general entries are
 * added to the end (last entry) and processed from the front (first
 * entry).  When used as stack, end is top and front is bottom.
 *
 * 2. The LIRS stack and queue.  These control page replacement.
 *
 * 3. Page entries are divided into disjoint "sublists" based on page
 * "state" i.e. the set of page properties.  Some sublists drive page
 * processing and have next entry to process at the front.
 *
 * Current sublists are as follows.  Those that drive processing are
 * marked with a plus (+).
 *
 * SL_BIND          + waiting for available buffer page
 * SL_MAP           + waiting to start pagein from disk
 * SL_MAP_IO        - above in i/o wait (the pagein)
 * SL_CALLBACK      + request done, waiting to invoke callbacks
 * SL_CALLBACK_IO   - above in i/o wait (pageout by cleanup)
 * SL_BUSY          - being written to by PGMAN client
 * SL_LOCKED        - permanently locked to cache
 * SL_OTHER         - default sublist
 *
 * PAGE PROCESSING
 *
 * Page processing uses a number independent continueB loops.
 *
 * 1. The "stats loop".  Started at node start.  Checks lists in debug
 * mode.  In the future could gather statistics and adjust parameters
 * based on load.  Continues via delay signal.
 *
 * 2. The "busy loop".  Started by page request.  Each loop does bind,
 * map, and callback of a number of entries.  Continues via no-delay
 * signal until nothing to do.
 *
 * 3. The "cleanup loop".  Started at node start.  Each loop starts
 * pageout of a number of dirty queue entries.  Continues via delay
 * signal.
 *
 * 4. The "LCP loop".  Started periodically by NDB.  Each loop starts
 * pageout of a number of hash list entries.  Continues via delay signal
 * until done.
 *
 * SPECIAL CASES
 *
 * LOCKED pages are not put on stack or queue.  They are flushed to disk
 * by LCP but not by clean-up.
 *
 * A TUP scan is likely to access a page repeatedly within a short time.
 * This can make the page hot when it should not be.  Such "correlated
 * requests" are handled by a request flag which modifies default LIRS
 * processing.  [fill in details later]
 *
 * Also PK operations make 2 rapid page references.  The 2nd one is for
 * commit.  This too should be handled as a correlated request.
 *
 * CLIENT TSMAN
 *
 * TSMAN reads "meta" pages such as extent headers.  There are currently
 * "locked" forever in PGMAN cache.
 *
 * CLIENT DBTUP
 * 
 * DBTUP works with copy pages (or UNDO buffers) in memory.  The real
 * page is updated only between page request with COMMIT_REQ flag and
 * a subsequent LSN update.  These need not occur in same timeslice
 * since DBTUP may need to flush UNDO log in-between.
 *
 * The page is "busy" if any transaction is between COMMIT_REQ and LSN
 * update.  A busy page must be locked in buffer cache.  No pageout of
 * a busy page can be started by clean-up or LCP.
