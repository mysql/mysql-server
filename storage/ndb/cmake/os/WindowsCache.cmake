# Avoid system checks on Windows by pre-caching  results. Most of the system checks
# are not relevant for Windows anyway and it takes lot more time to run them,
# since CMake  to creates a Visual Studio project for each tiny test.
# Note that values are cached for VC++ only, MinGW would give slightly
# different results.
