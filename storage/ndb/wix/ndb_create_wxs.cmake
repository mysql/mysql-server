# FUNCTION WIX_DESCRIBE_DIRS: Traverse empty dummy directory structure to create wxs-xml describing the desired install-layout.
#
# Describing the directory structure is made a bit tricky by the fact that a component-based 
# install, as done by _create_cmake.msi, will (and needs to) create a separate directory for each 
# component. Inside each component directory there is a normal bin, lib, share, ... hierarchy for 
# that component. But when creating the wxs-xml description all the subdirs 
# found in the various component directories must merged into one tree. Describing this merged virtual 
# tree in xml is difficult, e.g. when encountering the share directory for the first component an 
# xml tag for this directory is created. But before the end-tag can be insterted all of the 
# subdirectories of share must be added. But other components may add other directories under share, 
# so no end tags can be inserted until the entire installation has been traversed. In create_msi.cmake
# this was handled by creating the merged directory tree with empty directories while traversing the 
# component-based installation, and then create the wxs-xml for the directories from this tree of 
# empty directories. Since _create_msi.cmake also leaves behind this directory tree it can be used to 
# simplify the logic of the WIX_DESCRIBE_DIRS function.
# Args:
#   dir - directory to describe the members of
#   prefix - indentation space
# Globals:
#   DIR_LIST - list of relative directories encountered. Index in list is the directorys wxs xml id 
#   CPACK_WIX_DIRECTORIES - aggregated wxs xml describing the directory structure

# FUNCTION WIX_DESCRIBE_COMPONENTS: Traverse files in each cpack install component directory and 
# create wxs-xml descriptions for each wix-component, (a wix-component is a file or group of files, 
# which is not the same as a cpack install component. The latter is a wix component group).
# 
# This is essentially a re-implementation of the same functionality in create_msi.cmake, 
# but with one crucial difference: Where create_msi.cmake tries to create a 1-to-1 mapping between the 
# (relative) file/directory name and its wxs-xml id, this function uses numeric ids. Trying to convert 
# filenames into ids causes a number of problems:
# 1) Not all characters that are legal in filenames are legal in wxs-xml identifiers
# 2) The old solution of mapping all illegal characters to '_' can (and does for some files in 
#    the Python installation) yield non-unique ids. This is illegal.
# 3) wxs-xml ids can only be 72 characters long. The old solution of 
#    truncating is error-prone as fewer characters are permitted as the first character of an id. 
#    (create_msi.cmake also has bugs where a truncated id is combined with additional character to 
#    produce an id that is still longer than 72 characters. 
# Using numeric ids elliminates these problems but the fact that the id cannot be obtained from the 
# file/directory name creates additional challenges. E.g. the id of a file's parent directory could previously be 
# obtained from the directory portion of the filename. Now this id is not known until the wxs-xml 
# for the directories have been created, and even then the ids are buried in the generated xml. 
# The solution is to store the directorry name (relative to the component directory) in a list, 
# and use the directory's index in this list as the id. The directories must be traversed first 
# to populate the list.
