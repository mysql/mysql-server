# since the top-level server CMakeLists.txt hard-codes this to 1, and it needs to be 0 to get the
# components-based install needed by installers. But doing it inside the script makes a mess of 
# cmake's dependency mechanisms because after modifying the cache value all VS projects are re-created,
# so that all targets are out of date. So the modification of the cache is now done as two separate target, 
# and the modifiaction in the script is disabled by this hack: The call to cmake to modify the 
# cache is transformed to a harmless echo command.
