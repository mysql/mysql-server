/**
  @page CPP_CODING_GUIDELINES_FOR_NDB_SE C++ Coding Guidelines for NDB Cluster

  The ndbcluster plugin (storage/ndb/plugin) uses the same coding
  style as the rest of the MySQL Server code.

  The rest of the NDB code has a long history, and uses
  many coding styles. When modifying and extending
  existing source files or modules, the coding style already
  used in that code should be followed in terms of
  indentation, naming conventions, etc. For completely new
  code, the MySQL Server conventions (with exceptions below)
  should probably be followed.

  Do not make changes to NDB code purely for the sake of
  changing from one formatting style to another. It just causes
  merge annoyances and makes patches harder to read, and we do
  not expect the style to ever become 100% consistent across
  all of the source code. However, it is okay to fix inconsistent
  style in lines that are changed for other reasons.

  One convention that should be followed for all new or
  modified code is that class member variables should be named
  with lowercase words separated by underscores '_', and prefixed
  with 'm_'. Like this:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  const char *m_my_class_member;
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - @subpage BRACES
  - @subpage ASSIGNMENT
  - @subpage USE_OF_NDBREQUIRE
*/

/**
  @page BRACES Braces

  <p>if, while, etc. *must* always have braces, and each brace
  should be on a separate line.</p>

  Good example:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  if (a == b)
      {
         dosomething();
      }
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Bad example:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  if (a == b) {
         dosomething();
      }
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Inline methods inside class (struct) are okay to write as shown
  below (i.e., opening brace is on the same line as the function
  declaration).
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  struct A
      {
         A() {
         }
      }
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*/

/**
  @page ASSIGNMENT Assignment
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  a = 3; // ok
  a= 3; // not ok
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*/

/**
  @page USE_OF_NDBREQUIRE Use of ndbrequire

  In the NDB kernel code, the ndbrequire() facility has
  historically been widely used. However, most of this is now
  considered misuse, and use of ndbrequire() should generally be
  avoided. Over time, we want to remove most or all
  ndbrequire() instances.

  There are three different classes of ndbrequire() usage, with
  corresponding replacement as follows:

  - Verification of code logic: Hitting this is a real bug,
    and the error message should be written accordingly. For this use, one
    option is ndbassert() (only enabled in debug builds), or
    we might need to add ndbchecklogic() or similar.

  - Hitting a configurable limit, which cannot be handled
    gracefully: For this, use ndbrequireErr(). The
    error message should suggest a configuration change to correct the
    problem, or refer to a section in the manual for
    more information.

  - Hitting hardcoded limits: We should really try to avoid
    this, but if it is unavoidable, or if it is a limit we
    think we will never hit, use ndbrequireErr() and add an
    appropriate error message.
