/**
  @file include/thr_rwlock.h
  MySQL rwlock implementation.

  There are two "layers":
  1) native_rw_*()
       Functions that map directly down to OS primitives.
       Windows    - SRWLock
       Other OSes - pthread
  2) mysql_rw*()
       Functions that include Performance Schema instrumentation.
       See include/mysql/psi/mysql_thread.h

  This file also includes rw_pr_*(), which implements a special
  version of rwlocks that prefer readers. The P_S version of these
  are mysql_prlock_*() - see include/mysql/psi/mysql_thread.h

/**
  Portable implementation of special type of read-write locks.

  These locks have two properties which are unusual for rwlocks:
  1) They "prefer readers" in the sense that they do not allow
     situations in which rwlock is rd-locked and there is a
     pending rd-lock which is blocked (e.g. due to pending
     request for wr-lock).
     This is a stronger guarantee than one which is provided for
     PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_READER_NP rwlocks in Linux.
     MDL subsystem deadlock detector relies on this property for
     its correctness.
  2) They are optimized for uncontended wr-lock/unlock case.
     This is scenario in which they are most oftenly used
     within MDL subsystem. Optimizing for it gives significant
     performance improvements in some of tests involving many
     connections.

  Another important requirement imposed on this type of rwlock
  by the MDL subsystem is that it should be OK to destroy rwlock
  object which is in unlocked state even though some threads might
  have not yet fully left unlock operation for it (of course there
  is an external guarantee that no thread will try to lock rwlock
  which is destroyed).
  Putting it another way the unlock operation should not access
  rwlock data after changing its state to unlocked.

  TODO/FIXME: We should consider alleviating this requirement as
  it blocks us from doing certain performance optimizations.
