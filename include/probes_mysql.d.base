/*
  The actual probe names in DTrace scripts will replace '__' by '-'. Thus
  insert__row__start will be insert-row-start.

  Recommendations for adding new probes:

  - each probe should have the minimal set of arguments required to
  unambiguously identify the context in which the probe fires. Redundant
  arguments (i.e. the ones that can be obtained in user scripts from previous
  probes' arguments or otherwise) may be added for convenience.

  - try to avoid computationally expensive probe arguments. If impossible,
  use *_ENABLED() macros to check if the probe is activated before
  performing expensive calculations for a probe argument.

  - all *-done probes should have a status argument wherever applicable to make
  it possible for user scripts to figure out whether the completed operation
  was successful or not.
  
  - for all status arguments, a non-zero value should be returned on error or
  failure, 0 should be returned on success.
