    weight relates to the desirability of a transaction being killed if it's
    part of a deadlock. In a deadlock situation transactions with lower weights
    are killed first.

    Examples of using the weight to implement different selection strategies:

    1. Latest
        Keep all weights equal.
    2. Random
        Assight weights at random.
        (variant: modify a weight randomly before every lock request)
    3. Youngest
        Set weight to -NOW()
    4. Minimum locks
        count locks granted in your lock manager, store the value as a weight
    5. Minimum work
        depends on the definition of "work". For example, store the number
        of rows modifies in this transaction (or a length of REDO log for a
        transaction) as a weight.

    It is only statistically relevant and is not protected by any locks.

    'killed' is indirectly protected by waiting_for->lock because

    lock is enough for that.
