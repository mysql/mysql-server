/**
  A simple wrapper around a mutex:
  Grabs the mutex in the CTOR, releases it in the DTOR.
  The mutex may be NULL, in which case this is a no-op.
  Templated to allow unit testing with mocked mutex. Not copyable since
  ownership of a mutex cannot be shared, but movable so that ownership can be
  transferred to a different Mutex_lock.
