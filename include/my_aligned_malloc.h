 Function allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
 Size and alignment parameters depend on platform on which the function is
 executed. Please check posix_memalign, memalign and _aligned_malloc functions
 for details. To conform with all platforms size should be multiple of aligment
 and aligment should be power of two.

 We can use C++17 aligned new/aligned delete on non-windows platforms once the
 minimum supported version of tcmalloc becomes >= 2.6.2. Right now TC malloc
 crashes.

 @param[in] size Multiple of alignment.
 @param[in] alignment Memory aligment, which must be power of two.

 @return Pointer to allocated memory.
