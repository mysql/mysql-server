  my_snprintf service

  Portable and limited vsnprintf() implementation.

  This is a portable, limited vsnprintf() implementation, with some
  extra features. "Portable" means that it'll produce identical result
  on all platforms (for example, on Windows and Linux system printf %e
  formats the exponent differently, on different systems %p either
  prints leading 0x or not, %s may accept null pointer or crash on
  it). "Limited" means that it does not support all the C89 features.
  But it supports few extensions, not in any standard.

  my_vsnprintf(to, n, fmt, ap)

  @param[out] to     A buffer to store the result in
  @param[in]  n      Store up to n-1 characters, followed by an end 0
  @param[in]  fmt    printf-like format string
  @param[in]  ap     Arguments

  @return a number of bytes written to a buffer *excluding* terminating '\0'

  @post
  The syntax of a format string is generally the same:
  % <flag> <width> <precision> <length modifier> <format>
  where everithing but the format is optional.

  Three one-character flags are recognized:
    '0' has the standard zero-padding semantics;
    '-' is parsed, but silently ignored;
    '`' (backtick) is only supported for strings (%s) and means that the
        string will be quoted according to MySQL identifier quoting rules.

  Both <width> and <precision> can be specified as numbers or '*'.
  If an asterisk is used, an argument of type int is consumed.

  <length modifier> can be 'l', 'll', or 'z'.

  Supported formats are 's' (null pointer is accepted, printed as
  "(null)"), 'b' (extension, see below), 'c', 'd', 'i', 'u', 'x', 'o',
  'X', 'p' (works as 0x%x), 'f', 'g'.

  Standard syntax for positional arguments $n is supported.

  Extensions:

  Flag '`' (backtick): see above.

  Format 'b': binary buffer, prints exactly <precision> bytes from the
  argument, without stopping at '\0'.
