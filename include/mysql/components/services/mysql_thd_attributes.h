  THD Attributes service allows to obtain data associated with the THD
  object, which keeps various attributes of the user session.

  Currently, following attributes are supported:

  - Query Digest Text
  - Query Text
  - Host or IP
  - Schema

  @section thd_attributes_init Initialization

  The service can be instantiated using the registry service with the
  "mysql_thd_attributes" name.

  @code
  SERVICE_TYPE(registry) *registry = mysql_plugin_registry_acquire();
  my_service<SERVICE_TYPE(mysql_thd_attributes)>
                                         svc("mysql_thd_attributes", registry);
  if (svc.is_valid()) {
    // The service is ready to be used
  }
  @endcode

  @section thd_attributes_query_digest_text Query Digest Text

  Query Digest represents converted SQL statement to normalized form. The code
  below demonstrates how query digest can be obtained from the service.

  @code
  my_h_string str;

  mysql_thd_attributes->get(m_thd, "query_digest",
                                   reinterpret_cast<void *>(&str));
  @endcode

  The buffer can be fetched using the code below:

  @code
  char buf[1024]; // buffer must be big enough to store the digest

  mysql_string_converter->convert_to_buffer(str, buf, sizeof(buf), "utf8mb3");
  @endcode

  After the string content has been copied into another buffer, it must be
  destroyed:

  @code
  mysql_string_factory->destroy(str);
  @endcode

  @section thd_attributes_query_text Query Text

  Query text represents complete SQL text currently being executed within a
  given session. The example code is identical to the one for Query Digest, the
  only difference is that attribute name "sql_text" should be used in this
  case.

  @section thd_attributes_host_or_ip Host or IP

  Host or IP text contains host or IP (if host unavailable) belonging to a
  client associated with a given session. The example code is identical to the
  one for Query Digest, the only difference is that attribute name "host_or_ip"
  should be used in this case.

  @section thd_attributes_schema Schema

  Schema text contains a name of database currently in use by a
  client associated with a given session. The example code is identical to the
  one for Query Digest, the only difference is that attribute name "schema"
  should be used in this case.
