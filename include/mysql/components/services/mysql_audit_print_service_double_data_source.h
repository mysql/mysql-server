  Audit print service allows to obtain data of the double type associated with
  the THD object, which keeps various data of the user session. It also allows
  to obtain data not necessarily bound with the user session.

  Currently, following data is supported:

  - Query time     ("query_time")     Query execution time [seconds].
  - Rows sent      ("rows_sent")      Row count sent to the client as a result.
  - Rows examined  ("rows_examined")  Row count accessed during the query.
  - Bytes received ("bytes_received") Byte count received from the client.
  - Bytes sent     ("bytes_sent")     Byte count sent to the client.

  @section double_service_init Initialization

  The service can be instantiated using the registry service with the
  "mysql_audit_print_service_double_data_source" name.

  @code
  SERVICE_TYPE(registry) *registry = mysql_plugin_registry_acquire();
  my_service<SERVICE_TYPE(mysql_audit_print_service_double_data_source)>
  svc("mysql_audit_print_service_double_data_source", registry);
  if (svc.is_valid()) {
    // The service is ready to be used
  }
  @endcode

  @section double_service_query_time Query Time

  Query Time represents query execution time in seconds.

  @code
  double value;

  svc->get(m_thd, "query_time", &value);
  @endcode
