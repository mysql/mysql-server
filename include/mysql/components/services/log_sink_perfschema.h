  Add a log-event to the ring buffer.

  We require the various pieces of information to be passed individually
  rather than accepting a log_sink_pfs_event so we can sanity check each
  part individually and don't have to worry about different components
  using different versions/sizes of the struct.

  We copy the data as needed, so caller may free their copy once this
  call returns.
