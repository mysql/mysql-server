  Keyring writer service provides APIs to add/remove
  sensitive data to/from keyring backend.

  Data stored within keyring should be uniquely identified using:
  1. Data ID
      An identifier associated with data - supplied by keyring APIs' callers
  2. Auth ID
      An identifier associated with owner of the data - suppled by keyring
      APIs' callers. If Auth ID is not provided, key is treated as an internal
      key. Such a key shalll not be accessible to database users using
      SQL interface

  @code
  bool write_key(const char *data_id, const char *auth_id,
                 const unsigned char *data_buffer, size_t data_length,
                 const char *data_type) {

    if (!keyring_writer.is_valid()) {
      return true;
    }

    return keyring_writer->store(data_id, auth_id, data_buffer, data_length,

  Store data identified with (data_id, auth_id) in keyring backend

  Examples: AES, SECRET

  Note: If components want to support aes_encryption service,
  it must support storing data of type AES.

  A success status implies that data is stored persistently on
  keyring backend and shall always be available for access unless
  removed explicitly.

  @note Implementation can restrict type and/or size of data that can be
        stored in keyring.

  @param [in]  data           Data to be stored. Byte string.
  @param [in]  data_size      Size of data to be stored
  @param [in]  data_type      Type of data. ASCII. Null terminated.
