  Structure which is used to represent datetime values inside MySQL.

  We assume that values in this structure are normalized, i.e. year <= 9999,
  month <= 12, day <= 31, hour <= 23, hour <= 59, hour <= 59. Many functions
  in server such as my_system_gmt_sec() or make_time() family of functions
  rely on this (actually now usage of make_*() family relies on a bit weaker
  restriction). Also functions that produce MYSQL_TIME as result ensure this.
  There is one exception to this rule though if this structure holds time
  value (time_type == MYSQL_TIMESTAMP_TIME) days and hour member can hold
  bigger values.
