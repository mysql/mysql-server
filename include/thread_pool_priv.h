  The thread pool requires access to some MySQL server error codes, this is

  All accesses to THD variables and functions are defined in this header file.
  A thread pool can also use DEBUG_SYNC and must thus include
  debug_sync.h
  To handle definitions of Information Schema plugins it is also required
  to include sql_profile.h and table.h.
