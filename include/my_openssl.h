  HAVE_STATIC_OPENSSL:
  This is OpenSSL version >= 1.1.1 and we are linking statically.
  We must disable all atexit() processing in OpenSSL, otherwise
  dlclose() of plugins might destroy data structures which are needed
  by the application.

  Otherwise: "system" OpenSSL may be any version > 1.0.0
  For 1.0.x : SSL_library_init is a function.
  For 1.1.y : SSL_library_init is a macro: OPENSSL_init_ssl(0, NULL)

  Note that we cannot in general call OPENSSL_cleanup(). Doing so from plugins
  would break the embedding main program. Doing so from client code may
  break e.g. ODBC clients (if the client also uses SSL).
