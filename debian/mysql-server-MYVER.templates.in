Template: mysql-server/error_setting_password
Type: error
_Description: Unable to set password for MySQL "root" user
 It seems an error occurred while setting the password for the MySQL
 administrative user.  This may have happened because the user already
 has a password, or because there was a problem communicating with the
 MySQL server.

 When installation finishes, you should verify that the account
 is properly protected with a password (see README.Debian for more
 information).

Template: mysql-server-@MYVER@/need_sarge_compat
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Support MySQL connections from hosts running Debian "sarge" or older?
 The way passwords were stored was not very secure. This has been improved
 with the drawback that clients (e.g. PHP) from hosts running Debian 3.1 Sarge
 will not be able to connect to account which are new or whose password have
 been changed. See /usr/share/doc/mysql-server-@MYVER@/README.Debian.
