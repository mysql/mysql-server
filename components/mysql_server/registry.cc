  @page PAGE_COMPONENTS_REGISTRY The Service Registry Service
  The Service Registry is a central part of Components subsystem. It maintains
  a list of the Service Implementations and allow acquiring them by any actor
  that has a reference to main Registry Service Implementation. For each Service
  a reference counter is maintained to make sure no one can remove any Service
  Implementation being actively used.
  The Service Implementations can be acquired by the Service name or by the full
  Service Implementation name.
  For each Service a default Service Implementation is distinguished, the first
  one to be added, but it is possible to change it at will at any point.

  A convenient RAII-style wrapper on Service acquisition and automatic release
  is provided, the my_service<T> class.
