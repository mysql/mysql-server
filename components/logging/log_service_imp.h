@brief

LOG SINKS: WRITERS

There are two types of writers.  "Modern services" like the XML or JSON
writers don't care whether a key/value pair is a table name or an error
message, or what -- a string is a string.  Thus, these services have to
cover just three cases:  format as string, format as integer, or format
as float.  Trivial.

The other type is services that write to a fixed format, like the
traditional MySQL error log.  The error log has a timestamp,
connection ID, severity label, and an error message, in that exact order.
The traditional error log service therefore doesn't attempt to process
all the information we might send its way; it just needs to know how to
retrieve the few items it's interested in, and about printing them in
the prescribed order.  All other information is ignored.  Still simple,
just a different kind of simple.


INPUT

So as we've seen, both kinds of writers are quite straightforward.
It's either "handle 3 storage classes" (which is simple) or "handle as
many specific item types are you're interested in".  The first group
(which handles any and all items) is actually the simplest, and perhaps
easier to read and understand than the second group, as they're little
more than a glorified

  switch (item->item_class) {
  case STRING:   sprintf(buf, "%s", item->value.data_string);
                 break;
  case INTEGER:  sprintf(buf, "%d", item->value.data_integer);
                 break;
  case FLOAT:    sprintf(buf, "%f", item->value.data_float);
                 break;
  }

Anything beyond that in a given source file is usually either
boilerplate code needed by the component framework (which is
going to be there no matter how simple or complex our actual
writer is) or required by the specific output format the sink
is intended to generate (writing e.g. JSON rows or XML tags,
escaping characters/entities in string values, indentation,
and so on).


ERROR MESSAGES THAT AREN'T STRINGS, AND OTHER INSANITY

So what if a service is looking for the error message, but it turns
out that message is not a string?

Well, first off, the well-know items (log message, error number, ...)
all also have a well-known storage class, so an error message for example
shall always be of string class.  Our code (submission API, filter, ...)
ensures this.  Additionally, there is code in the server to help guard
against broken modules that violate these guarantees, so individual
loadable services won't have to check that themselves, either.

In summary, if a case like that happens, it's a bug, and it's a bug that
we have tools to detect.  The expectation is NOT that services have to
convert data-types on the fly and be able to handle error messages that
are numbers, or integers that come wrapped in a string, or any such
nonsense.  It is true that modern writers like XML or JSON gracefully
handle this case at zero overhead (as they only look at storage class,
not type or semantics), but this is very specifically NOT required of
any service.
