/**
  Implements a Gmock Test suite class to test a component.

  Load the component under test and fetches a reference to it.

  It can also load an optional local test harness component, should the
  component under test require extra services the minimal chassis doesn't
  provide. Usually the harness is test oriented and mocks the services so
  that the test can run.

  @param test_service_t The service type of the service to test
  @param component_name The name of the component to load, or nullptr to avoid
  loading extra components
  @param service_name The name of the service to instantiate, or nullptr to
  avoid fetching service refs
  @param component_instance The instance of the test harness component to load
  with the minchassis, or nullptr if none
