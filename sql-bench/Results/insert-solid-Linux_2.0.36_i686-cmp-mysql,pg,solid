Testing the speed of inserting data into 1 table and do some selects on it.
The tests are done with a table that has 100000 rows.

Generating random keys
Creating tables
Inserting 100000 rows in order
Inserting 100000 rows in reverse order
Inserting 100000 rows in random order
Time for insert (300000): 947 wallclock secs (259.72 usr 21.92 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)

Testing insert of duplicates
Time for insert_duplicates (300000): 91 wallclock secs (59.65 usr  3.36 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
