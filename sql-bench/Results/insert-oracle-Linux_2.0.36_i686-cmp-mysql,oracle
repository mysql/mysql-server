Testing the speed of inserting data into 1 table and do some selects on it.
The tests are done with a table that has 100000 rows.

Generating random keys
Creating tables
Inserting 100000 rows in order
Inserting 100000 rows in reverse order
Inserting 100000 rows in random order
Time for insert (300000): 1017 wallclock secs (228.54 usr 28.12 sys +  0.00 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.00 CPU secs)
