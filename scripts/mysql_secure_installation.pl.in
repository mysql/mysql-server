# The actual script starts here

prepare();

print <<HERE;



NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MySQL
      SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

In order to log into MySQL to secure it, we'll need the current
password for the root user.  If you've just installed MySQL, and
you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
so you should just press enter here.

HERE

get_root_password();


#
# Set the root password
#

print "Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MySQL\n";
print "root user without the proper authorisation.\n\n";

if ( $hadpass == 0 ) {
  print "Set root password? [Y/n] ";
} else {
  print "You already have a root password set, so you can safely answer 'n'.\n\n";
  print "Change the root password? [Y/n] ";
}

my $reply = <STDIN>;
if ( $reply =~ /n/i ) {
  print " ... skipping.\n";
} else {
  set_root_password();
}
print "\n";


#
# Remove anonymous users
#

print <<HERE;
By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment.

HERE

print "Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] ";
$reply = <STDIN>;
if ( $reply =~ /n/i ) {
  print " ... skipping.\n";
} else {
  remove_anonymous_users();
}
print "\n";


#
# Disallow remote root login
#

print <<HERE;
Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

HERE

print "Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] ";
$reply = <STDIN>;
if ( $reply =~ /n/i ) {
  print " ... skipping.\n";
} else {
  remove_remote_root();
}
print "\n";


#
# Remove test database
#

print <<HERE;
By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

HERE

print "Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] ";
$reply = <STDIN>;
if ( $reply =~ /n/i ) {
  print " ... skipping.\n";
} else {
  remove_test_database();
}
print "\n";


#
# Reload privilege tables
#

print <<HERE;
Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

HERE

print "Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] ";
$reply = <STDIN>;
if ( $reply =~ /n/i ) {
  print " ... skipping.\n";
} else {
  reload_privilege_tables();
}
print "\n";

print <<HERE;



All done!  If you've completed all of the above steps, your MySQL
installation should now be secure.

Thanks for using MySQL!
