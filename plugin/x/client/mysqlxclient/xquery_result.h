/**
  Interface responsible for fetching 'resultsets'.

  The interface defines methods that correspond to X Protocol message flow
  which transmits multiple 'resultsets':

      loop has more resultsets
        group resultset
          loop has more columns
            server --> client: ColumnMetaData
          end
          loop has more rows
            server --> client: Row
          end
        end
        alt has more resultsets
          server --> client: FetchDoneMoreResultsets
        end
      end
      loop has more OUT-paramsets
        server --> client: FetchDoneMoreOutParams
        group resultset
          loop has more columns
            server --> client: ColumnMetaData
          end
          loop has more rows
            server --> client: Row
          end
        end
      end
      server --> client: FetchDone

  While designing it there was an assumption that the implementation may not
  fetch/buffers row data. Because of it some return containers may "grow" with
  the realization of the X Protocol flow.
