/**
  Class implements per client/session queue

  The queue is filled by `emplace` method, and read by `Protocol_decoder`
  idle-interface. The interface switches the decoder from blocking IO
  to short blocks. It is important to switch the short-blocks only when
  its needed. To mark that, `enable_emplace` method was added.
  In general it tell that user would like to receive a global notice, enables
  the queue and switches the decoder to `short-blocks`.
  Data can be also read from the queue manually (in custom places) by
  calling `encode_queued_items`.
