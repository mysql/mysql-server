  Rewrite CREATE TABLE queries.

  Remove ENCRYPTION and DATA|INDEX DIRECTORY clauses. Note that the
  CREATE keyword is expected to be located at the very beginning of
  the query string. The function is used by the ddl_rewriter plugin,
  and is intended used for CREATE TABLE queries generated by
  SHOW CREATE TABLE, e.g. when restoring output from mysqldump.

  @param       query            Original query.
  @param [out] rewritten_query  Rewritten query with clauses removed. If
                                there was no rewrite, rewritten_query will
                                not be modified.

  @retval true if the query was rewritten
