  @note
   1. this plugin shows how a client authentication plugin
      may read a MySQL protocol OK packet internally - which is important
      where a number of packets is not known in advance.
   2. the first byte of the prompt is special. it is not
      shown to the user, but signals whether it is the last question
      (prompt[0] & 1 == 1) or not last (prompt[0] & 1 == 0),
      and whether the input is a password (not echoed).
   3. the prompt is expected to be sent zero-terminated
