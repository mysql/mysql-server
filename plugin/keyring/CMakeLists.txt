# On Windows we always link the ssl library into each plugin
# because the MySQL server binary's symbols on windows are hidden
# so we need a separate copy of the SSL library in each plugin on that OS
#
# On unix by default all mysqld symbols
# (including the SSL library symbols of the library copy linked to it)
# are visible.
# So technicaly all plugins can use the mysqld's ssl library symbols on that OS.
# But since the plugins are already initializing the SSL library
# because of windows we still are linking a copy of the SSL library
# relying on the fact that the dynamic linker will prefer the symbols
# in the shared library to the ones exported by the hosting executable (mysqld).
# This causes problems with yaSSL, as it, unlike openssl,
# does not hide all of its global variables.
# So we get address sanitizer errors because of the global variable symbols
# duplicated when we statically link a copy of yassl into the plugins.
#
# So for yaSSL we are using the mysqld copy and rely on the fact
# that the initialization/deinitialization of the library is reentrant
# and can be done by both the server and the plugin.
