  @class Gcs_view_identifier

  This represents the identification of a certain view of a certain group in a
  moment in time.

  This identifier must increase monotonically and be unique,
  in order to provide the notion of "happened before".

  The get_representation() method is virtual, since each binding
  implementation might provide its notion of view identifier. The only
  mandatory property is that they should be comparable.
