/**
  @class Gcs_control_interface

  This interface represents all the control functionalities that a binding
  implementation must provide. Like all interfaces in this API, it is
  group-oriented, meaning that a single instance shall exist per group,
  as it was returned by the class Gcs_interface::get_control_session.

  It contains methods for:
  - View Membership;
  - Control Events;
  - Generic Data Exchange.

  View Membership contain operations that will conduct one to:
  - Belong to a group: join() and leave();
  - Information about its status: belongs_to_group() and
    get_current_view() that shall return the active Gcs_view.

  Due to the asynchronous nature of this interface, the results of
  join() and leave() operations, in local or remote members, shall come
  via an event. Those events shall be delivered in form of callbacks
  defined in Gcs_control_event_listener, that should be implemented by a
  client of this interface interested in receiving those notifications.

  Regarding Generic Data Exchange, it is a functionality that was created
  to allow exchange of arbitrary data among members when one joins.
  This generic data is retrieved via the callback get_exchangeable_data() each
  time a View Change (VC) occurs. It states the data that one would like to
  offer in exchange whenever a VC happens.

  What must happen under the hood is that, when one receives a VC from
  the underlying GCS, the binding implementation should start a round
  of message exchange, in which members (one or all depending of the algorithm)
  send the Exchangeable Data to the joining node.

  That data is delivered when Gcs_control_event_listener::on_view_changed is
  called, which hands-out all exchanged data in one point in time.

  A typical usage for that interface would be:

  @code{.cpp}
  class my_Gcs_control_event_listener: Gcs_control_event_listener
  {
    void on_view_changed(const Gcs_view *new_view,
                         const Exchanged_data &exchanged_data)
    {
      // D something when view arrives...
      // It will also deliver all data that nodes decided to offer at join()
      // time
    }

    Gcs_message_data &get_exchangeable_data()
    {
      // Return whatever data we want to provide to a joining node
    }
  }

  // Meanwhile in your client code...
  Gcs_control_interface *gcs_control_interface_instance; // obtained
                                                         // previously

  Gcs_control_event_listener *listener_instance=
    new my_Gcs_control_event_listener();

  int ref_handler=
    gcs_control_interface_instance->add_event_listener(listener_instance);

  // Normal program flow... join(), send_message(), leave()...

  gcs_control_interface_instance->join();

  gcs_control_interface_instance->leave();

  // In the end...
  gcs_control_interface_instance->remove_event_listener(ref_handler);

  @endcode
