/**
 * @brief The Gcs_tagged_lock class
 * Implements a tagged lock for optimistic read-side sections.
 *
 * In a nutshell, the tagged lock is a read-write spin lock which offers the
 * following API:
 *
 *     try_lock() -> bool
 *     unlock()
 *     optimistic_read() -> tag
 *     validate_optimistic_read(tag) -> bool
 *
 * For the write-side section, one uses it as a typical spin lock, e.g.:
 *
 *     do:
 *       lock_acquired := try_lock()
 *     while (not lock_acquired)
 *     write-side section
 *     unlock()
 *
 * For the read-side section, one can use it as follows:
 *
 *     done := false
 *     while (not done):
 *       tag := optimistic_read()
 *       unsynchronised read-side section
 *       done := validate_optimistic_read(tag)
 *       if (not done):
 *         rollback unsynchronized read-side section
 *
 * The idea is to allow an optimistic read-side section that does not perform
 * any memory stores.
 * This is in contrast with a typical read-write lock, where the read side
 * performs some memory stores to account for the reader, e.g. keeping a reader
 * counter.
 * The trade off is that:
 *
 *   a. the execution of the read-side of a tagged lock may be concurrent with
 *      the write-side section if meanwhile the tagged lock is acquired
 *   b. the read-side of a tagged lock may fail if meanwhile the tagged lock is
 *      acquired, in which case one may want to rollback the effects of the
 *      failed read-side section
 *
 * The tagged lock is implemented over a single atomic 64-bit word with the
 * following bit layout:
 *
 *     bit #    64  63  62        3   2   1
 *            +---+---+---+-...-+---+---+---+
 *            |   |   |   |     |   |   |   |
 *            +---+---+---+-...-+---+---+---+
 *             \__________  ___________/ \ /
 *                        \/              v
 *                        tag            locked?
