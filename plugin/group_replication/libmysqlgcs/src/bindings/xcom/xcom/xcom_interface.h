/**
  Delivers the @c app payload to XCom's upper layer, e.g. GCS.

  Please note the following contract regarding the parameter of this function:
  If @c app_status is @c delivery_ok, then it means that XCom reached
  consensus on @c app. In this situation, @c pma MUST point to the Paxos
  instance (@c pax_machine) where @c app got consensus on. In other words, @c
  pma MUST NOT be NULL.

  In summary, this function is expected to be called as follows if a payload
  @c p reached consensus:

    deliver_to_app(<pointer to pax_machine where p was decided>, p, delivery_ok)

  This function is expected to be called as follows if a payload @c p did NOT
  reach consensus:

    deliver_to_app(_, p, delivery_failure)

  Where the @c pma argument may be a pointer to the pax_machine where @c p
  failed to get consensus, or NULL.

  Failure do adhere to this contract will result in an assert failure, at least
  on non-release builds.

  @param pma The Paxos instance where the @c app payload obtained consensus
  @param app The payload that was decided for the Paxos instance @c pma
  @param app_status The reason for @c app delivery: @c delivery_ok if the @c app
  payload reached consensus on the @c pma Paxos instance, or @c delivery_failure
  if XCom was unable to reach consensus
