   * 2. A function instructing XCom how to reply to the request

   * Basically, this future's result is equivalent to the reply GCS would get if
   * it used a TCP socket to send the request to XCom.
   * XCom will resolve this future when it receives and processes the request.
   * When GCS retrieves the future's result, GCS obtains a std::unique_ptr to
   * the Reply. Unless you do any shenanigans with this std::unique_ptr, when it
   * goes out of scope the Reply object is destroyed.
   * The Reply object owns the payload of XCom's reply (pax_msg), so the Reply
   * object destroys the pax_msg when it is destroyed.
