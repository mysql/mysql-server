/**
  This class is a core component of the database state machine
  replication protocol. It implements conflict detection based
  on a certification procedure.

  Snapshot Isolation is based on assigning logical timestamp to optimistic
  transactions, i.e. the ones which successfully meet certification and
  are good to commit on all members in the group. This timestamp is a
  monotonically increasing counter, and is same across all members in the group.

  This timestamp, which in our algorithm is the snapshot version, is further
  used to update the certification info.
  The snapshot version maps the items in a transaction to the GTID_EXECUTED
  that this transaction saw when it was executed, that is, on which version
  the transaction was executed.

  If the incoming transaction snapshot version is a subset of a
  previous certified transaction for the same write set, the current
  transaction was executed on top of outdated data, so it will be
  negatively certified. Otherwise, this transaction is marked
  certified and goes into applier.

    Flag to indicate that certifier is handling already applied
    transactions during distributed recovery procedure.

    On donor we may have local transactions certified after
    View_change_log_event (VCLE) logged into binary log before VCLE.
    That is, these local transactions will be appear on recovery
    and also on GCS messages. One can see on example scenario below:

     GCS order | donor binary log order | joiner apply order
    -----------+------------------------+--------------------
        T1     |          T1            |       T1
        T2     |          T2            |       T2
        V1     |          T3            |       T3 (recovery)
        T3     |          V1            |       V1
               |                        |       T3 (GCS)
    -----------+------------------------+--------------------

    T3 is delivered to donor by both recovery and GCS, so joiner needs
    to ensure that T3 has the same global identifier on both cases, so
    that it is correctly skipped on the second time it is applied.

    We ensure that T3 (and other transactions on that situation) have
    the same global identifiers on joiner by:
      1) When the VCLE is applied, we set on joiner certification info
         the same exact certification that was on donor, including the
         set of certified transactions before the joiner joined:
         group_gtid_extracted.
      2) We compare group_gtid_extracted and group_gtid_executed:
         If group_gtid_extracted is a non equal subset of
         group_gtid_executed, it means that we are on the above
         scenario, that is, when applying the last transaction from
         the distributed recovery process we have more transactions
         than the ones certified before the view on which joiner joined.
         So until group_gtid_extracted is a non equal subset of
         group_gtid_executed certifier will generate transactions ids
         following group_gtid_extracted so that we have the same exact
         ids that donor has.
      3) When joiner group_gtid_extracted and group_gtid_executed are
         equal, joiner switches to its regular ids generation mode,
         generating ids from group_gtid_executed.
