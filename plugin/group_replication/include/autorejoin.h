/**
  Represents and encapsulates the logic responsible for handling the auto-rejoin
  process within Group Replication. The auto-rejoin process kicks in one of two
  possible situations: either the member was expelled from the group or the
  member lost contact to a majority of the group. The auto-rejoin feature must
  also be explicitly enabled by setting the group_replication_autorejoin_tries
  sysvar to a value greater than 0.

  This thread will do a busy-wait loop for group_replication_autorejoin_tries
  number of attempts, waiting 5 minutes between each attempt (this wait is
  achieved via a timed wait on a conditional variable).

  We execute the auto-rejoin process in its own thead because the join operation
  of the GCS layer is asynchronous. We cannot actually block while waiting for a
  confirmation if the server managed to join the group or not. As such, we wait
  on a callback invoked by an entity that is registered as a GCS event listener.
