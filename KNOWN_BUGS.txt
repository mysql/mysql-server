This file should contain all known fatal bugs in Mariadb and the Aria
storage engine for the last source or binary release. Minor bugs,
extensions and feature requests, and bugs found since this release can
be found in the MariaDB bugs database at: http://mariadb.org/jira and
in the MySQL bugs databases at: http://bugs.mysql.com/ (category
"Maria storage engine").

There should not normally be any bugs which affect normal operations
in any MariaDB release. Still, there are always exceptions and edge
cases and that is what this file is for.

If you have found a bug that is not listed here, please add it to
http://mariadb.org/jira so we can either fix it for next release or in
the worst case add it here for others to know!


IMPORTANT:

If you have been using the Maria (now Aria) storage engine with the
MySQL-5.1-Maria-alpha build and are upgrading to a newer MariaDB you
MUST run [m]aria_chk --recover on all your Aria tables. This is because
we made an incompatible change with how the transaction id is stored
and old transaction id's must be reset!

cd mysql-data-directory
aria_chk --recover */*.MAI

Going forward, we will do our best to not introduce any incompatible
changes in the data format for Aria tables. If this would be ever be
needed, we will, if possible, support both the old and the new version
to make upgrades as easy as possible.

Note that for the MariaDB 5.1 release the Aria storage engine is
classified as 'beta'; It should work, but use it with caution. Please
report all bugs to http://mariadb.org/jira so we can fix them!
