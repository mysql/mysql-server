/// Polymorphism-free memory resource class with custom allocator and
/// deallocator functions.
///
/// This is used as the "back-end" for Allocator objects.  The
/// allocator and deallocator functions are member objects of type
/// std::function, specified as constructor arguments.
///
/// Example: a class that needs to allocate memory, and should have a
/// way to use a specified PSI key, can be implemented as follows:
///
/// - For each type the class needs to allocate, it has one member
///   object of type Allocator.  The constructor takes a
///   Memory_resource parameter, which defaults to a
///   default-constructed Memory_resource.  The constructor passes the
///   Memory_resource to the Allocator constructors.  The class calls
///   the Allocator member functions for its memory management.
///
/// - API clients that don't need a PSI key don't need to pass a
///   Memory_resource to the constructor; they use the default value
///   for the parameter.  API clients that need a PSI key, pass a
///   Memory_resource object where the allocate/deallocate functions
///   are PSI-enabled.  Such a Memory_resource object can be obtained
///   from the factory function @c psi_memory_resource in
///   sql/psi_memory_resource.h.
///
/// Notes on design choices:
///
/// We avoid using polymorphism to configure the behavior of the
/// allocate/deallocate member functions.  Classes that use
/// polymorphic memory resources would have to take a reference or
/// pointer to the memory resource as argument, so either the class
/// can't own the memory resource or it has to be dynamically
/// allocated.  If the class can't own the memory resource, it
/// complicates the usage since the caller has to ensure the
/// Memory_resource outlives the class that uses it.  If the
/// Memory_resource has to be allocated dynamically, that allocation
/// cannot use a custom Memory_resource, which may defeat the purpose
/// of using custom Memory_resources to track all allocations.
///
/// We also avoid static polymorphism, since every user of a
/// statically polymorphic Memory_resource would have to be a
/// template, which has two problems: first, two classes with the same
/// behavior but different allocation strategies would be different
/// types.  Second, any class that allocates memory and has a
/// requirement that the API client can configure the Memory_resource,
/// has to be templated and therefore be defined in a header.
///
/// With the current solution, the caller just creates a
/// Memory_resource object and passes it to the allocator.
