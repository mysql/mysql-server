/// Non-owning manager for a fixed sequence of memory buffers, which
/// is split into a read part and a write part, with a movable split
/// position.
///
/// This has a read/write position (which @c Buffer_sequence does not
/// have).  It does not have functionailty to grow the buffer sequence
/// (as @c Managed_buffer_sequence has).
///
/// Objects have one internal contiguous container (vector or list),
/// which is split into two parts, each of which is a
/// Buffer_sequence_view: the first part is the read part and the
/// second part is the write part.  API clients typically write to the
/// write part and then move the position forwards: this will increase
/// the read part so that API clients can read what was just written,
/// and decrease the write part so that next write will happen after
/// the position that was just written.
///
/// The position that defines the end of the read part and the
/// beginning of the write part has byte granularity.  Therefore, it
/// does not have to be at a buffer boundary.  When it is not on a
/// buffer boundary, a buffer has to be split.  When a buffer is
/// split, the sequence needs one more element than the actual number
/// of (contiguous) buffers.  When the position is moved from a buffer
/// boundary to a non-boundary, the number of used elements increases
/// by one.  To avoid having to shift all the buffers for the write
/// part one step right when the container is a vector, there is
/// *always* one more element than the actual number of contiguous
/// buffers.  So when the position is at a buffer boundary, an unused
/// "null buffer" is stored between the read part and the write part.
/// In other words, the buffer sequence has one of the following
/// forms:
///
/// ```
/// Position at buffer boundary:
/// Here, there are N buffers where the first R ones are read buffers.
///   [b_1, ..., b_R, null, b_{R+1}, ..., b_N]
///
/// Position not at buffer boundary:
/// Here there are N buffers where the first R-1 ones are read buffers,
/// and the R'th one is split into a read part and a write part.
///   [b_1, ..., b_R[0..x], b_R[x..], b_{R+1}, ..., b_N]
///```

/// typically unsigned char.

/// or `std::list`.
