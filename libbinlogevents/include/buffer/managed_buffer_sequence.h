/// Owned, non-contiguous, growable memory buffer.
///
/// This class never moves buffer data, but is non-contiguous.  It is
/// implemented as a container of Buffer objects.
///
/// Objects have a growable size, a movable position, and two
/// buffer_sequence_view objects called the read part and the write
/// part, which are accessible through the member functions @c
/// read_part and @c write_part.  The read part is everything
/// preceding the position, and the write part is everything following
/// the position.  API clients acting as producers should write to the
/// write part and then move the position forward as many bytes as it
/// wrote.  API clients acting as consumers should read the read part.
///
/// Generally, std::ostringstream or std::vector<char> are safer and
/// simpler interfaces for buffers and should be preferred when
/// possible.  However they do not fit all use cases:
///
/// - std::ostringstream is preferrable and more convenient when
///   appending existing data to the stream.  But it is not suitable
///   for interaction with C-like APIs that produce data in a char*
///   given by the caller.  The user would need to allocate a buffer
///   outside the ostringsteam and then append the buffer to the
///   ostringstream, which would imply unnecessary memory and cpu
///   overheads.
///
/// - When using a C-like API that produces data in a char* given by
///   the caller, std::vector is often good.  The user can reserve as
///   much memory as needed and then pass the underlying data array to
///   the API.  However, the following properties are sometimes
///   advantageous for Managed_buffer_sequence:
///
///   - Vector has no practical way to put an exact bound on the
///     memory usage.  Managed_buffer_sequence uses a Grow_calculator
///     which allows exact control over memory usage, including a
///     maximum size.
///
///   - Vector has to copy all existing data when it grows.
///     Managed_buffer_sequence never needs to copy data.  Since it
///     allows data to be non-contigous, it retains existing buffers
///     while allocating new ones.
///
/// The main drawbacks of Managed_buffer_sequence are that it is
/// non-standard, has a minimal feature set, and is non-contiguous.
///
/// This class never throws any exception.
///
/// @tparam Char_t the type of elements stored in the buffer:
/// typically unsigned char.
///
/// @tparam Container_tp The type of container to hold the buffers.
/// This defaults to std::vector, but std::list is also possible.
