/// Description of a heuristic to determine how much memory to allocate.
///
/// This may be used in diverse contexts such as growing a memory
/// buffer, or growing a pool of objects.
///
/// This encapsulates several common heuristics for growth:
///
/// - The growth rate can be exponential.  This is useful for cases
///   such as contiguous memory buffers, where each size increment may
///   copy all the existing data, e.g., using 'realloc'.  Or, more
///   generally, any data structure where size growth has a cost that
///   is linear in the total size.  In such cases an exponential
///   growth rate ensures that execution time is not quadratic in the
///   number of grow operations.
///
/// - The growth rate can be linear.  This is useful for cases such as
///   linked lists, where each size increment is linear in the
///   increment size.
///
/// - There can be an upper bound on the size.  This is useful
///   e.g. when there are configurable memory limits.
///
/// - The size can be specified to be a multiple of a given number.
///   This can potentially be useful if there is a way to align
///   allocated objects to page sizes, or similar.

  /// - It never shrinks.  If the request is smaller than the existing
  ///   size, it just returns the existing size.
