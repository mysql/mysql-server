  @class Rotate_event

  When a binary log file exceeds a size limit, a ROTATE_EVENT is written
  at the end of the file that points to the next file in the sequence.
  This event is information for the slave to know the name of the next
  binary log it is going to receive.

  ROTATE_EVENT is generated locally and written to the binary log
  on the master. It is written to the relay log on the slave when FLUSH LOGS
  occurs, and when receiving a ROTATE_EVENT from the master.
  In the latter case, there will be two rotate events in total originating
  on different servers.

/**
  @class Gtid_event
  GTID stands for Global Transaction IDentifier
  It is composed of two parts:
    - SID for Source Identifier, and
    - GNO for Group Number.
  The basic idea is to
     -  Associate an identifier, the Global Transaction IDentifier or GTID,
        to every transaction.
     -  When a transaction is copied to a slave, re-executed on the slave,
        and written to the slave's binary log, the GTID is preserved.
     -  When a  slave connects to a master, the slave uses GTIDs instead of
        (file, offset)

  The event is originated by source's dump thread and sent straight to
  replica without being logged. Slave itself does not store it in relay log
  but rather uses a data for immediate checks and throws away the event.

  Two members of the class m_log_filename and m_log_position comprise
  @see the rpl_event_coordinates instance. The coordinates that a heartbeat
  instance carries correspond to the last event source has sent from
  its binlog.

  Also this event will be generated only for the source server with
  version > 8.0.26
